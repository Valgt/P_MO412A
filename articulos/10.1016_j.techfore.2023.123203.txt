                  Global environmental outcomes, productivity, inclusion, and equality aspects are already beginning to be impacted by artificial intelligence (AI), both immediately and over time. AI is expected to have both beneficial and detrimental effects on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Nevertheless, there is a lacuna in the literature regarding systematically forecasting `AI's impact on different facets of SDGs over time in various countries. Moreover, though existing literature has reported a correlation between AI and innovation, no prior studies have forecast the influence of AI-based innovation on SDG Outcomes. To fill these significant research gaps, this study forecasts the impact of AI-based innovation on achieving SDGs over nine years, extending from 2022 to 2030 in 22 countries (including both developed and developing countries) across five continents via system dynamics modeling-based simulation and grounded in Institutional Theory (Technology Enactment Framework). The findings exhibit varying impacts on different SDGs. This study enriches the AI, innovation, and sustainable development literature by providing forecasts of the intricate relationship between AI, innovation, and SDGs, thereby offering valuable insights to the reader.

This is consistent with the findings of Wang et al. (2020) , who state that countries showing good scores in achieving SDG12 are implementing advice-rendering information systems for agricultural sustainability, environmental certification for global market supply, robotics for âvirtualâ experiments in manufacturing processes, big data for manufacturing and consumption patterns, and AI-based sensing. However, H3c is not supported for most other developed (e.g., Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, France, Turkey, the USA, the UK, the UAE, and Russia) and developing countries (e.g., Iran, India, Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Egypt, China, and Uzbekistan). Consequently, H3c is not supported. This is in line with the research by Dolezal and Novelli (2022) , who found that the relationship between AI and sustainable development is complex and context-specific, with mixed results across different countries. However, since developing countries are anticipated to show better performance in achieving SDG12 compared to developed countries, H4k, which proposed that the better institutional arrangements in developed countries help them perform better in achieving AI-based innovation and resultant better SDG12, is not supported. This is contradicted by the findings of Johansen and Vestvik (2020) , who found that developed countries tend to have better institutional arrangements for promoting innovation, including financial support for research and development, intellectual property protection, and policies that encourage responsible consumption and production.    item S0040-1625(23)00888-0 S0040162523008880

AI is expected to have both beneficial and detrimental effects on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Nevertheless, there is a lacuna in the literature regarding systematically forecasting `AI's impact on different facets of SDGs over time in various countries. Moreover, though existing literature has reported a correlation between AI and innovation, no prior studies have forecast the influence of AI-based innovation on SDG Outcomes. To fill these significant research gaps, this study forecasts the impact of AI-based innovation on achieving SDGs over nine years, extending from 2022 to 2030 in 22 countries (including both developed and developing countries) across five continents via system dynamics modeling-based simulation and grounded in Institutional Theory (Technology Enactment Framework). The findings exhibit varying impacts on different SDGs. This study enriches the AI, innovation, and sustainable development literature by providing forecasts of the intricate relationship between AI, innovation, and SDGs, thereby offering valuable insights to the reader.

However, human progress has resulted in environmental deterioration, social inequity, resource depletion, disputes, and even international wars since the beginning of the industrial revolution. For these reasons, the United Nations (UN) and other international organizations have long advocated for the concept of âsustainable development,â seeing it as a framework for achieving human progress that strikes a good balance between economic, environmental, and social concerns. Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being widely used with continuous improvements in science and technology, producing a dramatic shift in human civilization (Johnson et al., 2022 ). It is, practically, hard to block the development of increasingly powerful AI technology due to people's hunger for positive advances.1  1 For instance, AI can optimize energy systems, improve efficiency and reduce waste, enabling sustainable development. It can also help to predict natural disasters, optimize agriculture, and manage water resources more efficiently, reducing the negative impact on the environment. Additionally, AI can facilitate the development of sustainable products and services, promoting a circular economy (Johnson et al., 2022 ).   Concurrently, many are anxious about the possibility of expanding wealth gaps and hastening the death of our civilization (Lee et al., 2022 ). These scenarios are referred to as a dilemma or a trilemma. People have either balanced or polarized attitudes to these concerns, much like other concerns, such as climate change, where the trend is visible and unavoidable. As a result, academic researchers have revived their interest in AI over the last 50Â years (Di Vaio et al., 2020 ). AI is anticipated to impact significantly on global environmental outcomes, productivity, inclusion, and equality. AI's effects on sustainable development2  2 In this study, I define sustainable development as per the 17 interconnected SDGs from the United Nations (UN) and 169 targets internationally agreed upon in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These are âshared blueprints for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.â These 17 SDGs are: 1) No Poverty, 2) Zero Hunger, 3) Good Health and Well-being, 4) Quality Education, 5) Gender Equality, 6) Clean Water and Sanitation, 7) Affordable and Clean Energy, 8) Decent Work and Economic Growth, 9) Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, 10) Reduced Inequality, 11) Sustainable Cities and Communities, 12) Responsible Consumption and Production, 13) Climate Action, 14) Life Below Water, 15) Life on Land, 16) Peace and Justice Strong Institutions, 17) Partnerships to achieve these Goals (United Nations, 2022a ).   have been mixed (Lammers et al., 2022 ). However, no prior published study systematically predicts the extent to which AI may influence each facet of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) over time in different developed and developing countries.3  3 Anecdotal evidence shows that this influence may vary across different developed and developing countries due to differences in socio-economic conditions, institutional factors, and policy environments. Developed countries may benefit more from AI-based innovation due to their better infrastructure, more advanced technology, and higher levels of education and research. Developing countries may struggle to adopt and adapt AI technology due to limited resources and infrastructure, resulting in a potential widening of the technology divide between developed and developing nations. Hence, a comparative analysis is necessary to identify the factors that influence the impact of AI-based innovation on the achievement of SDGs in different developed and developing countries (Mathiyazhagan et al., 2021 ).   This indicates a crucial research gap, as anecdotal evidence indicates that AI might impact on the capacity to achieve each SDG (Leal Filho et al., 2022 ). Therefore, a comparative analysis would contribute to the extant literature by providing empirical evidence on the impact of AI-based innovation on SDGs in different developed and developing countries and identifying the factors that influence that impact. Moreover, although existing literature has reported a correlation between AI and innovation (Pietronudo et al., 2022 ), and between innovation and SDGs (Abbasi et al., 2022 ), no prior studies have forecast the influence of AI-based innovation on SDG outcomes in cross-country settings. Therefore, a critical research gap exists in this area. To address this critical research gap, this study investigates the following research question grounded in Institutional Theory (Technology Enactment Framework)4  4 The Technology Enactment Framework, based on institutional theory, examines institutions, organizations, and information technologies.  : What is the impact of AI-based innovation5  5 These AI-based Innovations include the Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented Reality, Blockchain, Virtual Reality, 5G Communication Infrastructure, Digital Twin, Big Data, Recommender, and Information Systems.   on achieving SDGs over time in developed and developing nations? To answer this research question, this study examined how AI-based innovation can either catalyze or impede the achievement of each of the 17 SDGs outlined in the 2030 Agenda. AI makes machines act intelligently (Di Vaio et al., 2020 ; McCarthy et al., 2006 ). Thus, AI is the capacity of a system to perform tasks smartly in ever-expanding regions and over time (Berente et al., 2021 ), precisely construing external data and utilizing these lessons towards accomplishing certain aims through an agile setup (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2020 ). Therefore, the research question is answered from a system dynamics perspective6  6 System dynamics is a methodology used to analyze complex systems, it involves the development of mathematical models that capture the dynamic behavior of a system over time. It is particularly useful for studying systems with feedback loops, delays, and non-linear relationships between variables (Forrester et al., 1976 ). In the context of this paper, system dynamics is used to model the complex interactions and feedback loops between AI-based innovation and SDGs in a cross-country setting, taking into account differences in social, economic, and political conditions.   (Forrester, 1958 ; Forrester et al., 1976 ). Since SDG9 represents innovation, this research also explores the interaction between SDG9 and the rest of the SDGs separately. This is also a unique contribution of this study as it explores the complex interaction between SDG9 and the rest of the SDGs. It should also be noted that this study categorizes the 17 SDGs by the three pillars of sustainable development: social,7  7 Social categories include: 4) Quality Education, 5) Gender Equality, 10) Reduced Inequality, 11) Sustainable Cities and Communities, 16) Peace and Justice Strong Institutions, and 17) Partnerships to achieve these Goals (Ranjbari et al., 2021 ).   economic,8  8 Economic categories include: 1) No Poverty, 2) Zero Hunger, 3) Good Health and Well-being, 8) Decent Work and Economic Growth, and 9) Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (Ranjbari et al., 2021 ).   and environmental,9  9 Environmental categories include: 6) Clean Water and Sanitation, 7) Affordable and Clean Energy, 12) Responsible Consumption and Production, 13) Climate Action, 14) Life Below Water, and 15) Life on Land (Ranjbari et al., 2021 ).   following Ranjbari et al. (2021) . Although each construct of this research has been studied separately in the past, studying their interaction is novel because it presents a fresh perspective on the impact of AI-based innovation on SDGs, which has not been explored in the existing literature. This novel approach is grounded in the Technology Enactment Framework (TEF), which originated in Institutional Theory (Fountain, 2001 ). TEF examines how institutional, organizational, technical, and situational variables impact on SDG attainment across countries, and this framework is used to explore the impact of particular institutional arrangements and organizational structures on the characteristics of the technology. By extending TEF to demonstrate the coexistence of AI and innovation in accomplishing SDGs, the paper adds a new perspective to the existing literature. Furthermore, the paper combines institutional theory and system dynamics to better understand the complex interaction between AI, innovation, and SDGs. Thus, the study's contribution lies in providing a theoretical framework that integrates institutional theory and system dynamics to analyze the interaction between AI, innovation, and SDGs. Hence, this paper makes a significant contribution to the extant literature on AI, Innovation, Sustainable Development, and System Dynamics. Apart from these theoretical contributions, this study also provides valuable contributions to practitioners and policymakers as a planning tool and useful guideline. The paper continues as follows. The following section examines the existing literature concerning the overall research theme and the variables under consideration. The section that follows establishes the research design before presenting the data analyses. The paper concludes with sections on the findings, conclusion, and possible future research directions.  2 Literature review and research framework 2.1 Institutional theory as the theoretical framework Researchers are starting to understand the intricate relationship with the social context across countries in which an AI-based innovation environment is chosen, developed, implemented, and used (He et al., 2022 ; TurrÃ³ et al., 2014 ). According to this theory, social structures and AI have a complicated and recursive relationship that makes the results of AI unpredictable and uncertain. These studies assert that organizational, social, and technological contexts affect AI (Munoko et al., 2020 ). One of these integrative approaches is institutional theory, which acknowledges the context in which artificial intelligence is embedded and explains how various institutions and factors influence the choice, design, implementation, and use of AI in a cross-country context (GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2020b ). Institutions have been conceptualized in various ways throughout institutional theory's evolution. They are regarded as guidelines for human behavior or acceptable social conduct (Kabengele and Hahn, 2021 ). According to Struckell et al. (2022)  and Aparicio et al. (2021) , institutions are viewed as behavioral rules based on a variety of significant foundations, including culture, social norms, mental models, legislation, and political arrangements. These various foundations can be summarized as cultural-cognitive, normative, and regulative pillars that symbolize institutions in a cross-country context (Lehmann et al., 2022 ). In sustainable development discussions, institutions are crucial. Both developed and developing nations require individuals and businesses to protect the environment and society (Gerged and Almontaser, 2021 ). This trend is supported by international treaties signed in the second part of the 21st century. Conventions on human rights and working conditions adopted by the UN and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are two such examples. Ethical and sustainability issues become more important as societal norms and values change (GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2020a ). Thus, institutionalism explains why people and businesses behave socially responsibly, how different nations approach sustainable business growth, and how this approach evolves (Barba-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2019 ; Fritz et al., 2021 ). In this regard, SDGs culminate in many universally agreed-upon rules, principles, and guidelines intended for individuals, businesses, and normative institutional initiatives. Thus, formal and informal institutions will influence individuals' and businesses' involvement with sustainability themes like SDGs (Fritz et al., 2021 ; Gerged and Almontaser, 2021 ). Modgil et al. (2020)  argue that Institutional Theory benchmarks individuals' and firms' competitive behavior to achieve SDGs in a cross-country context. However, the SDGs themselves may also be seen as an initiative taken by institutions. The Technology Enactment Framework (TEF) is a conceptual framework, based on Institutional Theory (Fountain, 1995, 2001 ), which explains how technology is implemented and used within organizations and across countries. According to the TEF, the implementation and use of technology are influenced by institutional structures, bureaucratic hierarchies, social norms, and information technologies' convergence (Fountain, 2001 ). This framework's underlying logic is that âobjective technologiesâ are transformed into âenacted technologiesâ through organizational and/or individual forms10  10 Structural dimensions such as centralization, formalization, communication channels, and organizational bureaucratic characteristics are examples of organizational forms (Gil-Garcia, 2005 ).   and institutional arrangements.11  11 Institutional arrangements shape users' perceptions and behaviors towards technology, including cognitive institutions, culture, socio-structure, and legal norms. Cognitive institutions are mental routines and cognitive models that affect behavior and decision-making. Cultural institutions are characterized as shared symbols, such as stories or meanings (Fountain, 2001 ).   Similarly, the choice, design, and implementation of enacted technologies impact on organizational forms and institutional structure in a cross-country setting (Mu et al., 2022 ). As a result, the technology enactment framework recognizes the recursive nature of the relationships between organizational, institutional, and enacted technologies. Fig. 1   illustrates the Technology Enactment Framework (TEF) (Fountain, 2001 ). In the context of this paper, I have not considered the recursive nature of organizational forms, institutional arrangements, and enacted technologies' relationships. Rather, I have considered unidirectional relationships among the aforementioned factors. In this paper, Objective Technologies are AI, associated hardware and software, and all the features (potentials) that are not always utilized. For example, multiple hidden functionalities of AI are known and used by a limited number of individuals. In contrast to all the features which could have been included (Objective Technology), Enacted Technologies are those aspects of AI that are actually in use (they are part of the current information system or systems). To be more precise, Enacted Technology in this paper is Innovation, which refers to the outcome of AI use (Objective Technologies). In terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency, this innovation (Enacted Technology) results in specific outcomes in achieving SDGs. As mentioned earlier, Enacted technologies are affected by the organizational forms which imply the context or social aspects of using AI (e.g., whether AI implementation is a bureaucratic/straightforward process, the social capital12  12 Social capital refers to the interconnected relationships among individuals within a particular group or society, which facilitate its effective functioning (Akizu-Gardoki et al., 2018 ).   in using AI). These Organizational Forms (the context of AI utilization) are catalyzed or hindered by institutional arrangements in a country symbolized by laws, rules, and other cultural, cognitive, or socio-structural controls in this study. A literature review on each of the aforementioned constructs and their interrelationship is conducted below: 2.1.1 Artificial intelligence (AI) Even though the study of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been going on for the last six decades, it is still challenging to come up with a consensus on the definition of this âset of technologies.â In fact, the term âAIâ refers to diverse technologies, for instance, robotics, deep learning, machine learning, speech recognition, image recognition, computer vision, natural language processing, and analytics that mimic human behavior, rather than a single technology or even a class of technologies (Huang and Rust, 2018 ). Huang and Rust (2018)  claim that AI is a machine with intelligence. Truong and Papagiannidis (2022)  define AI as computer intelligence that mirrors cognitive abilities, including problem-solving. AI was defined by Longoni et al. (2019)  as any computer that utilizes any algorithm or numerical method to execute human-like cognitive, perceptual, and conversational activities. AI, in contrast to older manufacturing or information technologies, is able to learn from data, process data for human use, and update outcomes without the need for programming or human involvement (Huang and Rust, 2018 ). For instance, AI researchers have created potent algorithms that can assist social scientists in overcoming the difficulties associated with analyzing âbigâ behavioral data, such as SDGs (Leal Filho et al., 2022 ). The above literature review shows that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving technology that has revolutionized how we live and work. AI is the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. AI has been at the forefront of many innovative breakthroughs in recent years and has been found to impact significantly on innovation in various industries (Truong and Papagiannidis, 2022 ).  2.1.2 AI and innovation Innovation is crucial for the growth of businesses in today's rapidly changing world because innovation creates valuable products, services, and processes. The innovation process typically consists of four stages: 1) concept discovery and creation; 2) filtering; 3) testing; and 4) refinement and commercialization of the winning idea (Truong and Papagiannidis, 2022 ). While humans have exceptional problem-solving skills, AI has advanced to the point where it can do complex tasks, and it has the potential to streamline innovation by processing vast volumes of data and information that innovators must navigate (Cockburn et al., 2019 ). By automating tasks such as categorization, grouping, and prediction, AI can help innovators focus on more mentally taxing but less judgment-heavy support activities. This can reduce the time and money spent on processing data and enable innovators to spend more time on creative problem-solving (Cockburn et al., 2019 ). AI can also be used to improve the innovation process by providing insights and recommendations based on data analysis. AI, for instance, can be used to analyze customer feedback and determine areas of a product or service that might benefit from being improved. According to Haefner et al. (2021) , this can assist innovators in refining their ideas and developing products and services that more effectively meet the needs of customers. AI can also enhance collaboration among innovators. By providing real-time insights and data analysis, AI can help team members stay informed and make more informed decisions. This can lead to better communication and collaboration among team members, which can help to speed up the innovation process (Cockburn et al., 2019 ). Despite the above positive impact of AI on innovation, it also poses some challenges for innovation. For instance, while AI has advanced to the point where it can do complex tasks, it is still largely utilized for niche applications that need careful human oversight. Humans are still needed as the source of fresh ideas and innovations, as creativity and problem-solving skills are not easily replicated by AI (Amabile, 2020 ). By leveraging AI's strengths and addressing the aforementioned concerns, innovators can use AI to drive innovation and create valuable products, services, and processes.  2.1.3 Sustainable development goals (SDGs) Fifty years of discussion and agreement on sustainable development led to SDGs. To help move the world onto a more sustainable and resilient path, global leaders at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in 2015 endorsed the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which they call âa plan of action for people, planet, and prosperity.â This universal, integrated, and transformative agenda is based on 17 SDGs, 169 targets, and 232 indicators (United Nations, 2022a ). Fig. 2   depicts all 17 SDGs organized into three pillars: environmental, social, and economic. The new SDGs framework, which is more ambitious than the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), includes bolder goals, such as the end of poverty (SDG1), zero hunger (SDG2), good health and well-being for all (SDG3), quality education (SDG4), gender equality (SDG5), clean water and sanitation (SDG6), access to affordable, sustainable, and clean energy (SDG7), decent work and economic growth (SDG8), industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG9), reduced inequalities (SDG10), sustainable cities and communities (SDG11), responsible consumption and production (SDG12), actions to combat climate change (SDG13), protecting and promoting sustainability for life below water (SDG14), protecting life on land (SDG15), peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG16), and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development (SDG17) (United Nations, 2022a ). The SDGs balance economic, social, and environmental sustainability. They are unique in requiring all nations and their citizens to reduce inequalities. National governments, transnational companies, and civil society can end poverty, promote economic growth, and address social and environmental needs through the Goals. The 2030 Agenda also encourages private sector and partnership involvement to help governments use all the tools needed to implement and deliver change (United Nations, 2022a ).  2.1.4 AI's role in achieving SDGs through innovation In accordance with the SDGs, AI-based innovation is currently being used to address the world's most significant issues. These powerful forces are bringing about change in both the business world and society by forming public-private partnerships that bring together a wide range of specialized knowledge. AI is already being applied to all 17 SDGs (GSMA, 2022 ). Specifically, AI promotes SDG9, which embraces three essential attributes of sustainable development: infrastructure, industrialization, and innovation. 2.1.4.1 AI in achieving the economic pillar of SDGs through innovation According to the technology enactment framework of institutional theory, SDG9 (AI-based innovation) contributes to the success of the economic pillar of the SDGs (SDG1â3 and SDG8), which focuses on creating sustainable, inclusive, and equitable economic growth and development (Mathiyazhagan et al., 2021 ). For instance, AI-based innovation (such as digital financial services) stimulates economic growth, creates employment opportunities (SDG8), and reduces poverty (SDG1) in cross-country settings, as indicated by several prior studies. First, AI (objective information technology) will boost global GDP by 14Â % to $15.7 trillion in 2030, more than China and India combined (World Economic Forum, 2023 ). AI could generate between $3.5 and $5.8 trillion in annual value across various industries. This increased value can be attributed to AI's ability to automate repetitive tasks, optimize processes, and improve decision-making (Truong and Papagiannidis, 2022 ). Secondly, AI-based innovation (enacted technology) can lead to job creation and upskilling. Contrary to the popular belief that AI will lead to massive job displacement, several studies have suggested that AI-based innovation can create new jobs and increase demand for skilled labor. For instance, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) estimates that AI could create approximately 7.2 million new UK jobs by 2037 (Kollewe, 2023 ). Moreover, AI can also facilitate upskilling and reskilling of the workforce by providing personalized training and learning opportunities in different countries (Kollewe, 2023 ). Thirdly, AI-based innovation can promote inclusive economic growth by reducing inequalities and improving access to services. For instance, AI can improve access to financial services by automating credit scoring and underwriting processes, thus reducing bias and improving financial inclusion. Additionally, SDG9 (such as innovative food storage and preservation strategies, sustainable crop production, and sustainable livestock farming) facilitates the achievement of SDG2 (Zero Hunger by 2030). In addition, SDG9 (e.g., innovative health technologies) is indispensable for improving health and lowering infant, maternal, and adult mortality rates (SDG3) (United Nations, 2022c ). Consequently, the following is hypothesized:H1 AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences the SDGs' economic pillar13  13 The four associated sub-hypotheses are provided in Table 18 in the Appendix.   (i.e., SDG1-3 and SDG8).    2.1.4.2 AI in achieving the social pillar of SDGs through innovation According to the technology enactment framework of institutional theory, SDG9 (AI-based Innovation) also contributes to the success of the SDGs' social pillar (SDG4-5, SDG10-11, and SDG16-17) in cross-country settings (Mathiyazhagan et al., 2021 ). For instance, AI-based innovation can positively influence SDG4 by making education more accessible, personalized, and inclusive. With online learning platforms, adaptive learning systems, and intelligent tutoring systems, AI-powered technologies (objective technology) can cater to the diverse needs of learners and provide personalized assessments, feedback, and real-time learning. This innovation also enables inclusive and equitable education, supporting learners with disabilities and providing education access to remote and underserved areas (Lammers et al., 2022 ). AI-based innovation (enacted technology) can also support professional development for educators, provide personalized training and mentoring, and analyze data to identify learning gaps and opportunities for improvement in different countries (United Nations, 2022d ). In conclusion, AI-based innovation can enhance the quality of education and support evidence-based decision-making, contributing positively to SDG4. AI-based innovation can also positively influence SDG5, which aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Through safety apps, online campaigns, sensor-laden smart dresses, and AI-powered diversity and inclusion tracking platforms, AI-based innovation can enhance women's safety, promote their rights, and advance gender equality (United Nations, 2022c ). AI-powered technologies can also provide insights into gender-based biases and discrimination, helping policymakers develop evidence-based policies to tackle these issues. By reducing the gender gap in access to technology, AI-based innovation can facilitate women's participation in the digital economy and improve their economic opportunities (de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2020 ). Overall, AI-based innovation can promote gender equality and women's empowerment, contributing positively to SDG5. AI-based innovation can also positively influence SDG10, which aims to reduce inequalities within and among countries. AI-based innovation can help to narrow the digital divide and promote social and economic inclusion by facilitating access to technologies and knowledge for disadvantaged segments of society. AI-powered technologies can also provide personalized services and solutions, improving access to healthcare, education, and other essential services for marginalized communities (Cosenz et al., 2020 ). By analyzing data, AI-based innovation can also help to identify and address inequalities in different domains, such as income, education, and health. In addition, AI-based innovation reduces inequality within and between nations, communities, and populations by facilitating access to technologies and knowledge for disadvantaged segments of society (SDG10) (Fritz et al., 2021 ). Overall, AI-based innovation can contribute to reducing inequalities and promoting social and economic inclusion, supporting the achievement of SDG10. AI-based innovation can also positively influence SDG11, which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Through 3D-scanning technology, AI-based decision-making for urban planning, green public transport, and AI-powered air quality platforms, AI-based innovation can contribute to building smart, sustainable, and livable cities (de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2020 ). By optimizing resource allocation, improving infrastructure, and enhancing urban mobility, AI-based technologies can improve the quality of life for urban residents, while reducing the environmental impact. Furthermore, AI-based innovation can support disaster response and management, ensuring the resilience of urban areas (Lammers et al., 2022 ). Overall, AI-based innovation can contribute to creating sustainable and inclusive cities, supporting the achievement of SDG11. AI-based innovation can also positively influence SDG16, which aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. Through AI-powered data analysis and decision-making, AI-based innovation can help to promote transparency, accountability, and good governance, supporting the establishment of effective and inclusive institutions (GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2020a ). By analyzing data on crime and security, AI-based technologies can also support crime prevention and improve public safety, promoting peaceful societies. Furthermore, AI-based innovation can also support conflict resolution and reconciliation efforts by analyzing social media data and other sources of information (Gerged and Almontaser, 2021 ). Overall, AI-based innovation can promote peace, justice, and inclusive institutions, supporting the achievement of SDG16. AI-based innovation can also positively influence SDG17, which aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. Through virtual meeting platforms, AI-based decision-making for partnering, and other AI-powered technologies, AI-based innovation can facilitate public-private partnerships that mobilize all available resources for sustainable development by bringing together the Government, private sector, and civil society (Abbasi et al., 2022 ). By optimizing resource allocation and enhancing collaboration between different sectors, AI-based technologies can also improve the effectiveness and efficiency of developmental cooperation. Furthermore, AI-based innovation can provide insights into the impact of different policies and interventions, enabling evidence-based decision-making for sustainable development (GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2020a ). Overall, AI-based innovation can contribute to revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development, supporting the achievement of SDG17. Consequently, the following is hypothesized:H2 AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences the SDGs' social pillar14  14 The six associated sub-hypotheses are provided in Table 18 in the Appendix.   (i.e., SDG4-5, SDG10-11, and SDG16-17).    2.1.4.3 AI in achieving the environmental pillar of SDGs through innovation According to the technology enactment framework of institutional theory, the environmental pillar of the SDGs (SDG6-7 and SDG12-15) also benefits from SDG9 (AI-based innovation) in cross-country settings (Mathiyazhagan et al., 2021 ). For instance, AI-based innovation can positively influence SDG6, which aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Through the analysis of data on water quality and usage, AI-based technologies (e.g., the water sector's digital transformation) can support the optimization of water supply and sanitation systems, improving access to clean water and sanitation services. Furthermore, AI-based innovations can also support the management of water resources and monitoring of water-related risks, such as floods and droughts (de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2020 ). Overall, AI-based innovation (enacted technology) can contribute to improving water management and increasing access to clean water and sanitation worldwide, supporting the achievement of SDG6. AI-based innovation can also positively influence SDG7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Through analyzing energy data, AI-based technologies (objective technology) can support the optimization of energy generation, distribution, and consumption, reducing waste and increasing efficiency. Furthermore, AI-based innovations can also support the integration of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, and off-grid energy systems into existing energy systems, facilitating the transition to a more sustainable energy mix (Ranjbari et al., 2021 ). Overall, AI-based innovation can contribute to increasing access to affordable and sustainable energy, supporting the achievement of SDG7 worldwide. AI-based innovation can also positively influence SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by improving resource efficiency, reducing waste and pollution, and promoting sustainable practices. AI-based innovation (e.g., food system innovations such as automation and robotics in agriculture and personalized nutrition) can also enable more effective supply chain management, reduce the environmental impact, and promote circular economy models, thereby contributing to SDG9 and promoting sustainable development (Fritz et al., 2021 ). AI-based innovation (e.g., innovations to combat climate change such as innovative low-carbon products and services, AI-based green data centers, sophisticated climate modeling, and green power feeding systems) can also positively influence SDG13 (Climate Action) by facilitating the development and deployment of clean energy solutions, enhancing climate modeling and prediction, improving climate resilience, and supporting carbon capture and storage technologies. AI can also help to identify new opportunities for emissions reductions and enable more effective climate monitoring and mitigation strategies, contributing to achieving SDG9 and promoting sustainable development (Richter et al., 2022 ). AI-based innovation can also positively influence SDG14 (Life Below Water) by enhancing ocean monitoring and modeling, supporting sustainable fisheries management, and improving marine biodiversity conservation. AI can also enable real-time data collection and analysis, identify threats to marine ecosystems, and support effective response measures, contributing to achieving SDG9 and promoting sustainable development in different countries (Ranjbari et al., 2021 ). AI-based innovation can also positively influence SDG15 (Life on Land) by improving land-use mapping, enhancing wildlife conservation, and supporting sustainable forest management. AI can also enable more accurate biodiversity monitoring, identify and mitigate the impacts of human activities, and support ecosystem restoration efforts, contributing to the achievement of SDG9 and promoting sustainable development in cross-country settings (de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the following is hypothesized:H3 AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences the SDGs' environmental pillar15  15 The six associated sub-hypotheses are provided in Table 18 in the Appendix.   (i.e., SDG6-7 and SDG12-15).     2.1.5 Impact of cross-country institutional arrangements on the relationship between AI-based innovation and SDGs' achievement When governments use information and communications technology (ICT), the results vary (Richter et al., 2022 ). For instance, many countries have successfully collected income taxes online. However, new ICT systems sometimes fail to improve processes, data, or knowledge-sharing. Researchers and practitioners want to understand these complexities (Richter et al., 2022 ). The technology enactment framework (TEF) may help to understand these complexities (Fountain, 2001 ). âBuilding the Virtual Stateâ by Jane Fountain examines ICT's impact on government institutions. Fountain uses bureaucracy, neoinstitutionalism, networks, and governance research to present the technology enactment framework. It offers a more complete and convincing explanation than her partially developed theories. This allows an in-depth study of how organizational structure and institutional arrangements affect technology use for theory development. Fountain's conceptual separation of ICT components from actors' interpretations and practical applications is crucial. According to the TEF, technology serves three purposes: it manages the organization, becomes part of its infrastructure, and drives organizational change. Fountain refers to ICT-heavy states as âvirtual states,â a metaphorical term used to underscore their impacts on state structure, citizens, and corporations (Fountain, 2001 ). Apart from shedding light on formal institutions such as Government, TEF acknowledges the role of informal institutions such as unwritten rules, social norms, and shared beliefs in shaping how individuals, organizations, and societies adopt and use AI-based innovations (Aparicio et al., 2021 ). Informal institutions can impact on how people perceive and interpret AI, the level of trust they have in it, and the rules and regulations that govern its use. By incorporating informal institutions in TEF, researchers can better understand how AI-based innovations can be adopted, scaled up, and sustained in different social contexts. Informal institutions can also impact on how individuals and organizations approach sustainability and ethical issues (Aparicio et al., 2021 ). For example, shared beliefs and norms can shape people's perceptions and values vis-Ã -vis SDGs, influencing the extent to which they adopt sustainable practices and technologies. Understanding the role of informal institutions can help individuals and institutions to adopt AI-based innovations in a way that aligns with their values and norms and promotes sustainable and ethical practices (Styrin et al., 2022 ). The countries (mostly developed countries) that adopted the aforementioned institutional arrangements have made significant strides since 2015 in achieving SDGs through AI-based innovation. These developed countries have included SDGs in national plans, strategies, planning processes, parliaments, and multi-stakeholder institutions. These countries have also created high-level coordination mechanisms, dedicated strategies and roadmaps, data platforms, and collaborative reporting to engage stakeholders. Moreover, though many developed countries have failed to meet SDGs related to income inequality, education, climate change mitigation, and gender equality due to the lack of relevant innovations, they have, overall, performed well in economic development (World Economic Forum, 2017 ). Furthermore, as gaps or weaknesses emerge and circumstances change, these countries have implemented or adjusted key institutional systems concerning innovation-influenced SDG implementation. Conversely, developing countries, including the poorest, rank low in institutional arrangements, AI-based innovation, and SDG achievement (Dhahri et al., 2021 ). Consequently, the following is hypothesized:H4 AI-based innovation helps developed countries to achieve better results in SDGs16  16 The sixteen associated sub-hypotheses are provided in Table 18 in the Appendix.   due to better institutional arrangements than developing countries.   As per the above literature review, the theoretical and research models of this study are provided below in Figs. 3 and 4   , respectively:    3 Research methodology 3.1 System dynamics (SD) This research uses system dynamics (SD), established by Forrester in the 1950s and â60s. It simulates complex social systems to test new management and change methods. SD holds that âeffects may influence causes,â requiring business analysts to consider the entire system of interrelated relationships. SD also recognizes complex interconnected feedback loops and rejects a linear cause-and-effect relationship (Cosenz et al., 2020 ). SD simulates differently by modeling a system's behavior and element relationships by mapping its structure. It helps to understand and exploit complex management systems' feedback relationships. The model also provides a business planning or operational methodology for decision-making. Furthermore, the model can test various scenarios and predict future outcomes using historical data (Gao and Zhang, 2022 ).  3.2 System dynamics and sustainable development: A 50-year path System dynamics is a natural fit for sustainable Development analysis because it enables researchers to model and simulate the behavior of complex, interconnected systems over time. System dynamics is particularly relevant for sustainable development, which involves integrating economic, social, and environmental factors to achieve long-term, equitable outcomes (Pedercini et al., 2020 ). System dynamics facilitates well-analyzed policy development by identifying unintended consequences and trade-offs. It also encourages interdisciplinary collaboration, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of sustainable development (Randers, 2000 ). As shown in Fig. 5  , the two âSDsâ have coevolved over the last 50Â years due to a growth-generating feedback loop in which better analytical tools discover answers and new problems, which in turn encourages further methodological advances (Pedercini et al., 2020 ).  3.3 Research setting The impact of AI-based innovation on SDGs is simulated over a 9-year period, from 2022 to 2030, for 22 nations (including both developed and developing nations17  17 A developed nation has a high quality of life, a strong economy (e.g., high GDP, GNP, and per capita income), and an advanced technological infrastructure relative to less industrialized nations (IGI Global, 2022 ). On the other hand, a country with a lower HDI and a smaller industrial base is considered a developing nation (Bhimani et al., 2022 ).  ) across five continents (i.e., Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and Oceania). According to the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Index (HDI),18  18 While GDP per capita is a common indicator for categorizing countries as developed or developing, I opted for the HDI index for several reasons. The HDI index takes into account not only economic indicators but also social and human development factors, such as health and education, which provides a more comprehensive view of a country's development status (Bhimani et al., 2022 ). In this paper, I focus on all the SDGs (not only those related to the economic pillar). Hence, the UN HDI index is the index best-suited for this paper. Additionally, the HDI index is widely recognized and used by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as a measure of development, making it a relevant choice for this study (UNDP, 2022 ).   these 22 nations are either developed or developing (UNDP, 2022 ). The countries that rate as having âvery high human developmentâ in this index have been considered as âdeveloped,â and the rest of the countries as âdeveloping.â  3.4 Problem identification The procedure for system dynamics modeling, as outlined by Kazancoglu et al. (2021) , starts with a comprehensive understanding of the system under examination, followed by the demarcation of its boundaries19  19 In system dynamics modeling, âboundariesâ refer to the defined scope or limits of the system being analyzed. Determining the boundaries of a system is a crucial step in the modeling process, as it decides what is included within the system (i.e., variables, relationships) (Black, 2013 ).   and components. Within the framework of this study, a thorough consideration of all essential variables that influence the system is indispensable for accurately simulating the impacts of AI-based innovation on SDGs. Once the system parameters (variables or constructs) had been outlined, their interconnections were demonstrated through causal loop diagrams, as discussed by Kazancoglu et al. (2021) . These causal loop diagrams represent the system's internal interactions via positive or negative feedback loops. Analyzing these loops offers insights into the system's overall conduct, as evidenced in studies by Yuan and Wang (2014)  and Ricciardi et al. (2020) . Afterwards, the causal loop diagram underwent a transformation into a stock-and-flow diagram, with the help of Vensim software, to estimate parameter values. The subsequent sections outline the execution steps.  3.5 Sample and data To simulate the impacts of AI-based innovation on SDGs, I employed a comprehensive approach, drawing upon data from three distinct yet complementary data sets. The objective was to capture all the critical factors influencing the system, thereby offering a multifaceted perspective on the relationship between AI, innovation, and sustainability. The selection of countries for the study was vital to ensure a broad representation across the development spectrum. I included a diverse mix of 22 countries from both developed and developing nations. This selection enabled me to conduct comparative analyses and to account for the unique intricacies of AI-based innovation and SDG achievements across the globe. This selection not only offers a globally relevant perspective but also captures the context-specific nuances of AI-driven sustainable development, given the 22 countries' unique socio-economic characteristics and stages of development (Burchardt and Ickler, 2021 ; Qureshi, 2022 ). The developed countries examined in this study include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, the UK, and the US. These nations are often seen as leaders in technological adoption and provide a rich context for understanding how developed economies utilize AI-based in pursuit of their SDGs (Oxford Insights, 2022 ; United Nations, 2022a ; WIPO, 2022 ). In contrast, the study also encompasses developing nations, such as Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. While these countries face different challenges and are at varied stages of technological adoption, they have embarked on ambitious plans to incorporate AI when addressing their unique developmental goals (Oxford Insights, 2022 ; United Nations, 2022c ; WIPO, 2022 ). The Oxford Insights AI readiness survey  , an integral part of my data gathering, provides a comprehensive assessment of a country's preparedness to adopt and optimally exploit artificial intelligence (AI) in the domain of public service delivery. It employs a diverse set of indicators, such as existing infrastructure, talent base, regulatory frameworks, and the level of investment in AI-related research and development. Existing infrastructure evaluates digital resources, internet connectivity, and data centers (Oxford Insights, 2022 ). The talent base gauges the quantity and quality of AI skills available, including AI researchers, data scientists, and AI educators, in addition to the general population's digital literacy. Regulatory frameworks encompass data privacy laws and AI-specific regulations, assessing the adaptability of a country's legal and regulatory systems in relation to the emergence of AI. The level of investment in AI-related research and development indicates the financial commitment to AI advancement through public and private sector investment (Oxford Insights, 2022 ). Therefore, the survey offers a comprehensive view of each country's AI readiness, providing critical insights into AI adoption for policymakers, business leaders, and other stakeholders. Beyond data collection, the survey emphasizes the need for global efforts to bridge disparities in AI readiness, contributing to the worldwide promotion of equitable AI adoption (Oxford Insights, 2022 ). The SDG cross-country survey by the UN  , which offers a global overview of progress on implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, has been used to gather SDG-related data. The survey gathers data from countries around the world on a range of indicators related to SDGs, including poverty reduction, gender equality, climate action, and economic growth (United Nations, 2022a ). The objective is twofold: to render a broad-based image of individual nations' strides towards these global goals, and to understand the complex interplay of socio-economic, political, environmental, and cultural factors influencing such progress. Serving policymakers, researchers, and a broad spectrum of stakeholders, this survey describes a comprehensive landscape of the rate and quality of SDG advances, offering valuable insights into what drives success in different geopolitical environments (United Nations, 2022c ). More than a simple inventory, the SDG cross-country survey is a vibrant knowledge platform, merging global accountability for the 2030 Agenda commitments with an evolving repository of effective strategies for sustainable development, all while underscoring the indispensable role of international collaboration in tackling these shared challenges (United Nations, 2022a ). The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)âs Global Innovation Index  , an annual ranking of nations based on their capacity for and success in innovation, has been used to collect innovation-related data. This index, comprehensive in its approach, scrutinizes the innovation environment of each country, factoring in various dimensions, such as expenditure on research and development, the strength of intellectual property protection laws, and the quality of human capital, which includes education and training (WIPO, 2022 ). What sets the Global Innovation Index apart is its dual-purpose approach: it not only highlights exemplary practices that promote innovation and creativity, but also pinpoints areas that require improvement. As such, it serves as a roadmap for countries to enhance their innovation ecosystem (WIPO, 2022 ). The ultimate aim is to nurture a worldwide culture of innovation and creativity, underpinning the belief that innovation is a pivotal driver of sustainable economic growth and development. By offering an objective analysis of each country's innovation strengths and weaknesses, the index plays a fundamental role in shaping national and international policies aimed at promoting the robustness of the global innovation landscape (WIPO, 2022 ).  3.6 Measures of variables (model parameters) This multifaceted study gathers and examines data from several variables spanning three key categories: SDGs, AI Readiness, and Innovation. First, the SDGs, which are universally adopted by all United Nations Member States, form a set of objectives that strive to address a wide spectrum of societal challenges. Their purpose is to foster a better, more sustainable future for everyone by the year 2030. The SDGs encompass 17 interconnected goals (United Nations, 2022a ). For instance, SDG1 aims to eradicate extreme poverty, defined as individuals living on less than $1.25 per day and uses indicators such as the poverty headcount ratio and the poverty rate following taxes and transfers to measure progress. SDG2, titled Zero Hunger, strives to ensure that all people have access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food all year round, with progress assessed by indicators like the prevalence of undernourishment and the sustainable management of nitrogen, among others (United Nations, 2022b ). The remaining 15 SDGs are dedicated to other critical global objectives. Good Health and Well-being (SDG3) ensures healthy lives and promotes well-being for everyone at all ages. Quality Education (SDG4) aims for an inclusive and equitable quality education and promotes lifelong learning opportunities for all. Gender Equality (SDG5) aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG6) works towards ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for everyone (United Nations, 2022a ). Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG7) is focused on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG8) promotes sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for everyone. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG9) aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation. Reduced Inequality (SDG10), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG12), Climate Action (SDG13), Life Below Water (SDG14), Life on Land (SDG15), Peace and Justice, Strong Institutions (SDG16), and Partnerships to achieve the Goals (SDG17) also follow suit in this regard (United Nations, 2022c ). The second category, AI Readiness, evaluates a country's preparedness to implement AI in public services (Oxford Insights, 2022 ). This evaluation takes into account an array of indicators, including the Government's vision for AI, the presence of regulatory and ethical AI frameworks, the level of digital capacity within the Government, and the size and health of the technology sector. Other considerations include the skills available in the country, the state of technological infrastructure, and the availability of data for training AI models (Oxford Insights, 2022 ). The final category, Innovation, utilizes the Global Innovation Index to evaluate nations based on their capacity for and success in fostering Innovation. This category is subdivided into seven critical domains: institutions, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication, business sophistication, knowledge and technology outputs, and creative outputs (WIPO, 2022 ). Each domain consists of various measurable factors, including the political environment, education level, Research & Development investment, credit accessibility, the availability of knowledge workers, knowledge creation and diffusion, and intangible assets. Each of these areas provides a piece of the overall puzzle of a nation's capacity for innovation (WIPO, 2022 ).  3.7 Parameter scores For the base year of 2021, initial values of the aforementioned model variables were gathered. Consideration was given to the change rates of various variables based on the current state and the 2030 vision. The model variables are fully described in Table 1 in the Appendix.  3.8 Causal loop diagram of the model Having defined the system's boundaries and parameters, I developed a causal loop diagram, as per Cernev and Fenner (2020) , to investigate the interactions between associated variables and develop a system dynamics model. This diagram, grounded in the variables from Section 3.6  and presented in Fig. 6  , offers a qualitative view of the intricate relationship between AI-based innovation and the SDGs. In the diagram, reinforcing effects are represented by black arrows and denoted by âR,â while balancing loops are symbolized by red arrows and labeled as âB.â Notably, the diagram represents a generic causal loop diagram for 16 SDGs.  3.9 Model and data analysis procedure To create quantitative models (stock-flow diagrams), all the major factors that impact on the behavior of the SDGs through AI-based innovation are identified. Stock-flow diagrams are rooted in system dynamics, a methodology developed in the mid-20th century by Jay W. Forrester of MIT (Forrester et al., 1976 ). These diagrams allow us to visualize and understand the structure and behavior of complex systems, such as the interplay between AI-based innovation and SDGs. Stock, flow, converter, and connector are the four main elements of stock-flow diagrams, representing the variables under consideration and their equations (Cosenz et al., 2020 ). First, âStocksâ in a system dynamic model represent accumulations over time, such as population scorecards, water in a bathtub, books in a library, or money in a bank. In this research, the stock signifies SDG scores (goals 1â8 and 10â17) at any given moment. They can be understood as the âmemoryâ of the system, because they accumulate the net effect of inflows and outflows over time, showing the present state of each SDG (Gao and Zhang, 2022 ). However, these stocks are not static. They change over time due to âflows.â A flow is an activity that changes the stock, either by adding to it (inflows) or subtracting from it (outflows). For example, births represent the population's filling, and deaths its draining. When applied to the SDGs, flow could signify the rate of progress or setbacks in achieving these goals (increase and decrease rates of SDGs). For instance, an inflow might be new policies that accelerate progress towards an SDG, while an outflow could represent factors hindering progress, like a conflict or an economic downturn (Pedercini et al., 2020 ). Then, the âconverterâ (also known as âauxiliary variablesâ) in the model symbolizes the external inputs or variables that affect these flows. In system dynamics modeling, auxiliary variables are split into control and main variables. âControl variables,â often adjustable parameters, influence system behavior, while the âmain variablesâ represent the model outputs of primary interest (Richardson, 1991 ). In this context, AI-based innovation represents the main variable (converter), which signifies the transformative potential of AI technology to change the rate of progress of SDGs. For example, AI's role in optimizing resource use could accelerate the achievement of SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) (Ricciardi et al., 2020 ). Conversely, factors other than AI-based innovation that either boost or hinder the growth rate of each SDG can be classified as control variables (converter). Lastly, the âconnectorâ represents the interactions and relationships between these elements. It draws out the interdependencies between the stocks, flows, and converters, creating a comprehensive model of how each part of the system influences the others (Yuan and Wang, 2014 ). Figs. 7â22                  depict stock-flow diagrams (conceptual frameworks) for each SDG apart from SDG9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) using VENSIM software. VENSIM software is one of the best tools for system dynamic modeling due to its user-friendly interface, powerful simulation engine, versatility, robustness, and support and resources. Its interface is easy to use, and its equations are straightforward, making it suitable for building models quickly, even for complex systems. The simulation engine is fast and efficient, even for large models with many variables and feedback loops. VENSIM's versatility allows it to be used for various applications. Its robustness allows it to handle real-world problems. Moreover, the helpful user community and online resources provide a wealth of information for users (Del Vecchio et al., 2019 ). Overall, VENSIM is an excellent tool for system dynamic modeling. In the SDG1 stock-flow diagram (see Fig. 7 , below), the âstockâ represents the current state of poverty. This is impacted by two main âflowsâ: the âinflow,â or a rise in the SDG1 score, reflecting anti-poverty actions, and the âoutflow,â or a decrease in the score, indicating factors that exacerbate poverty. The inflow is positively influenced by both the âmain auxiliary variable,â like AI-based Innovation, and âcontrol auxiliary variables,â like Time to Achieve SDG1 Targets, Influence of SDG9, and Poverty Headcount Ratio. However, the Poverty rate after taxes and transfers can inadvertently increase poverty, slowing SDG1 progress. In the SDG2 stock-flow chart (Fig. 8 ), the âstockâ or SDG2 score signifies global hunger status. The âinflowâ (rise in SDG2 score) reflects anti-hunger actions, while the âoutflowâ (fall in score) indicates increasing hunger. AI-based Innovation (âmain auxiliary variableâ) and âcontrol auxiliary variablesâ, such as estimated SDG2 target achievement year, SDG9 influence, Human Trophic Level, Cereal Yield, Yield Gap Closure, and Sustainable Nitrogen Management Index, shape the inflow. Conversely, factors like undernourishment prevalence, child stunting and wasting, obesity, and hazardous pesticide exports boost the outflow, hindering SDG2 progress. In the SDG3 stock-flow graph (see Fig. 9 ), the âstockâ is the SDG3 score, reflecting global health. The scores for âinflowâ and âoutflowâ indicate health improvements and hindrances, respectively. The âmain auxiliary variableâ is AI-based Innovation, while âcontrol auxiliary variables,â such as the estimated SDG3 target achievement year, SDG9 influence, life expectancy, adolescent fertility rate, birth assistance by skilled health personnel, subjective well-being, and universal health coverage, foster inflow. Contrarily, factors like maternal and neonatal mortality, tuberculosis incidence, pollution-related deaths, smoking rates, disease death rates, new HIV infections, and traffic deaths fuel the outflow, suggesting ongoing health challenges. In the stock-flow diagram for SDG4 (as shown in Fig. 10 ), the âstockâ is the SDG4 score, symbolizing global education quality. The âinflowââincreased SDG4 scoreâand âoutflowââdecreased SDG4 scoreârepresent educational improvements and challenges, respectively. Influencing the inflow are the âmain auxiliary variables,â such as AI-based Innovation, and âcontrol auxiliary variables,â such as Year to Achieve SDG4 Targets, the influence of SDG9 on SDG4 Targets, technology's role in education, pre-primary organized learning participation, net primary enrollment, literacy rate, and tertiary attainment. However, factors such as low secondary completion and science underachievers increase the SDG4 outflow, highlighting educational challenges. In Fig. 11 's SDG5 stock-flow diagram, the âstockâ is the SDG5 score, representing global gender equality status. The inflow (representing an increased SDG5 score) signifies gender equality progress, while the outflow (indicating a decreased SDG5 score) denotes setbacks. The main auxiliary variable, such as AI-based Innovation, and control auxiliary variables, such as Year to Achieve SDG5 Targets, the influence of SDG9 on SDG5 Targets, family planning methods, female-to-male education & workforce ratio, and female parliamentary representation, drive the inflow. However, factors like the gender wage gap fuel the outflow, highlighting a key area needing policy attention for gender parity. Fig. 12 's SDG6 stock-flow model uses the âstockâ as the SDG6 score to denote the current global status of water and sanitation facilities. This model features two pivotal streams: the âinflow,â representing improvements in water and sanitation, and the âoutflow,â signifying the challenges being encountered. The inflow is influenced by the âmain auxiliary variable,â identified as AI-based Innovation, alongside âcontrol auxiliary variables', such as Time to Achieve SDG6 Targets, how SDG6 Targets are influenced by SDG9, accessibility of basic drinking water to the population, effective and safely managed sanitation services, rate of freshwater withdrawal, extent of wastewater treatment, and the amount of scarce water consumption embodied within imports. For SDG7, as depicted in Fig. 13 , the âstockâ represents the SDG7 score, highlighting the current global situation of Affordable & Clean Energy. The âinflowsâ reflect improvements in the score, arising from advances in affordable, clean energy, while âoutflowsâ represent decreases due to challenges like rising CO2  emissions from fuel combustion. The inflow is influenced by âmain auxiliary variables,â like AI-based Innovation, and âcontrol auxiliary variablesâ, such as the projected Time to Achieve SDG7 Targets, the influence of SDG9 on the SDG7 Target, the percentage of people with access to electricity and clean cooking fuels, as well as the share of renewable energy in the total primary energy supply, all of which strengthen the SDG7 inflow. In the stock-flow illustration pertaining to SDG8, as presented in Fig. 14 , the SDG8 score serves as the âstockâ representing the present international status of quality employment and economic growth. The âinflowsâ symbolize an upward trajectory in the SDG8 score, thereby encapsulating progress in aspects such as labor rights, accessibility to banking services, and adjusted growth in gross domestic product. A âmain auxiliary variableâ controlling the pace of inflow encompasses âAI-based Innovation,â whereas the rate of inflow is modulated by âcontrol auxiliary variablesâ like the Year to Achieve SDG8 Targets and SDG8 Target Influenced by SDG9. On the other hand, the âoutflowsâ denote a decline in the SDG8 score, attributed to negative factors like elevated youth unemployment, pervasive modern slavery, substantial inflation rate, widespread unemployment, and incidence of work-related fatalities. In the stock-flow schematic concerning SDG10, as depicted in Fig. 15 , the SDG10 score embodies the current worldwide status of equality, thereby constituting the âstock.â The âinflowsâ correspond to an upsurge in the SDG10 score, representing noteworthy advances towards absolute parity in income and wealth. Conversely, the âoutflowsâ denote a diminution in the SDG10 score, illustrating worsening disparities primarily attributed to uneven income distribution and poverty rates among the elderly population. The primary auxiliary variable regulating the inflow rate encompasses AI-based innovation, while the control auxiliary variable, which includes Year to Achieve SDG10 Targets and SDG10 Target Influenced by SDG9, modulates the inflow rate. In the stock-flow diagram for SDG11 (Fig. 16 ), the âstockâ is the SDG11 score, representing the current global state of urban sustainability. An increase in the SDG11 score represents the âinflow,â signifying progress in urban sustainability. The rate of this inflow is regulated by the âmain auxiliary variable,â AI-based innovation, and âcontrol auxiliary variablesâ including Year to Achieve SDG11 Targets, SDG11 Target Influenced by SDG9, access to improved water sources for urban dwellers, and satisfaction with public transportation systems. Conversely, the âoutflowâ signifies a decrease in the SDG11 score, highlighting challenges to urban sustainability, such as widespread slums, particulate matter pollution, and high rent burdens. Within the stock-flow framework for SDG12, as depicted in Fig. 17 , the SDG12 score serves as the âstock,â signifying the prevailing global condition of sustainable consumption and production. An upsurge in the SDG12 score constitutes the âinflow,â representing beneficial transitions towards conscientious consumption. The rate of this inflow is regulated by the âprimary auxiliary variable,â such as AI-based innovation, and âcontrol auxiliary variablesâ, such as Year to Achieve SDG12 Targets and SDG12 Target Influenced by SDG9. In contrast, the âoutflowâ intimates a diminution in the SDG12 score, highlighting problems such as excessive waste generation and emissions, which have detrimental effects on sustainable practices. Control auxiliary variables contributing to this âoutflowâ include elements like municipal solid waste, electronic waste, SO2,  and nitrogen emissions, exports of plastic waste, and non-recycled municipal solid waste. In the SDG13 stock-flow framework, as delineated in Fig. 18 , the âstockâ is denoted by the SDG13 score, reflecting the current global advancement in climate action. The âinflowâ corresponds to a rise in the SDG13 score, which is influenced by AI-based innovation as the âprimary auxiliary variableâ and âcontrol auxiliary variables,â such as Year to Achieve SDG13 Targets, SDG13 Target Influenced by SDG9, and an elevated Carbon Pricing Score, which symbolizes efficacious mitigation approaches. Conversely, the âoutflowâ signifies a reduction in the SDG13 score, attributable to factors such as CO2  emissions from fossil fuel combustion, cement manufacturing, imports, and fossil fuel exports, thereby highlighting the environmental burden. In the SDG14 stock-flow diagram (see Fig. 19 ), the âstockâ is represented by the SDG14 score, denoting the health of marine ecosystems. An increase in the SDG14 score signifies the âinflow,â driven by AI-based innovation as the âprimary auxiliary variable.â Other factors influencing the inflow include âcontrol auxiliary variables,â such as the Year to Achieve SDG14 Targets, SDG14 Target Influenced by SDG9, the average area of protection in crucial marine biodiversity sites, and the Ocean Health Index: Clean Waters score, highlighting successes in marine conservation. Conversely, the âoutflow,â indicating a decrease in the SDG14 score, arises from issues like fish extraction from overstrained or depleted stocks, trawling, discarding, and import-related threats to marine biodiversity. In the stock-flow model pertaining to SDG15, as illustrated in Fig. 20 , the SDG15 score operates as the âstock,â portraying the health of terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity and ecosystems. The âinflow,â symbolizing an enhancement in the SDG15 score, is influenced by AI-based innovation as the âmain auxiliary variable,â and Year to Achieve SDG15 Targets, SDG15 Target Influenced by SDG9, Mean Area Protected in Terrestrial and Freshwater Sites Important to Biodiversity, as âcontrol auxiliary variablesâ that bolster the inflow rate of SDG15, signifying advances in land and freshwater conservation. Contrarily, the âoutflow,â representing a diminution in the SDG15 score, is influenced by factors such as the Red List Index of Species Survival, Permanent Deforestation, and Terrestrial and Freshwater Biodiversity Threats Embodied in Imports. Within the stock-flow model for SDG16, as delineated in Fig. 21 , the SDG16 score constitutes the âstock,â reflecting the global standing of peace, justice, and robust institutions. The âinflowâ into this stock, a rise in the SDG16 score, is mediated by variables including AI-based innovation as the âprimary auxiliary variable,â and Year to Achieve SDG16 Targets, SDG16 Target Influenced by SDG9, the population's perception of safety, property rights, birth registrations, access to justice, and press freedom, as the âcontrol auxiliary variables.â In contrast, the âoutflow,â which signifies a reduction in the SDG16 score, is shaped by variables such as the prevalence of homicides, the number of unsentenced detainees, child labor involvement, levels of corruption, exports of conventional weaponry, and the number of incarcerated individuals. In a stock-flow diagram for SDG17 (see Fig. 22 , below), the âstockâ is the SDG17 score (Partnerships for the Goals), reflecting the global progress in fostering partnerships for achieving the SDGs. The âinflow,â signifying an increase in the SDG17 score, is driven by elements such as AI-based innovation as the âmain auxiliary variable,â and Year to Achieve SDG17 Targets, SDG17 Target influenced by SDG9, international concessional public finance for high-income and all OECD DAC countries, government revenue (excluding grants), the state of corporate tax havens, and government spending on health and education, as the âcontrol auxiliary variables.â Conversely, the âoutflowâ represents a decrease in the SDG17 score, dictated by elements like financial secrecy and shifted profits of multinationals, which expedite the SDG17 outflow rate.  3.10 Model validation procedure Before the study's simulation, a rigorous validation process was undertaken, following Wu et al. (2010) . Initial steps included conducting a âdimensional consistencyâ test, involving cross-verifying the model's dimensions defined in Table 1 with real-world counterparts, confirmed by experts. In addition, a âstructural verificationâ test was performed using the âCheck Modelâ function in Vensim software, verifying the model's accuracy in terms of variable relations and formulations. A final âbehavioral validationâ test compared simulation data against historical data from 2021 to 2022, encompassing key variables such as SDG achievement and AI-based innovation. With deviations <5Â %, the model's accuracy was substantiated, thus proving the simulation's reliability for future forecasting.   4 Results and analysis The simulation of the model is carried out over nine years, beginning in 2022 and ending in 2030. The result for each SDG is provided below: 4.1 SDG1 (ending poverty in all its forms worldwide) related results SDG1 (Economic Pillar) aims to end global poverty. Seven hundred and sixty-seven million developing country residentsâ1 in 5âlive on less than $1.90 per day. Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa suffer the most. Political-economic instability is linked to extreme poverty (United Nations, 2022d ). Table 2 in the Appendix presents the results for the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG1. From Table 2, it is evident that the estimated impact of AI-based innovation on SDG1 (No Poverty) is to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then increase continuously between 2023 and 2030 for developed nations such as Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Turkey, Russia, the UAE, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The same applies to developing nations such as Pakistan, Nigeria, Egypt, India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Iran. In Saudi Arabia (a developed country), the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG1 remained unchanged between 2021 and 2030. Moreover, China and Kenya are estimated to show decrease-increase-decrease and decrease-increase-decrease-increase trends, respectively.  4.2 SDG2 (zero hunger) related results SDG2 (Economic Pillar) seeks global hunger eradication by 2030. In 2020, 161 million more people were hungrier than in 2019. Hunger and food insecurity increased between 2014 and the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has exacerbated malnutrition, especially in children. The Ukraine war has recently caused a severe food crisis, disrupting global supply chains since the Second World War (United Nations, 2022d ). Table 3 in the Appendix shows how AI-based innovation has affected SDG2. From Table 3, it is evident that the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG2 (Zero Hunger) is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then increase continuously between 2023 and 2030 for developed nations such as Australia, Germany, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. The same applies to developing countries such as Vietnam, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, Bangladesh, China, and India. For the developed countries France, New Zealand, Turkey, and the UK, the influence of AI-based innovation on SDG2 is projected to fall continuously between 2021 and 2030. The same applies to the developing country Iran. For the USA, the influence of AI-based innovation on SDG2 is projected to fall continuously between 2021 and 2026. Then, the USA is estimated to witness a steady increase between 2027 and 2029.  4.3 SDG3 (good health and well-being for all) related results Sustainable development requires healthy lives and all-age well-being (SDG3). Unfortunately, COVID-19 has caused human suffering, destabilized the global economy, and disrupted the progress made in health (e.g., improved life expectancy and child and maternal mortality) before the pandemic. Hence, more efforts are needed to address many persistent and emerging health issues through health system funding, sanitation, hygiene, and physician access (United Nations, 2022d ). Table 4 in the Appendix summarizes the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG3 (Economic Pillar). From Table 4, it is evident that the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being) is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then increase continuously between 2023 and 2030 for developed nations such as Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, the USA, and the UK. The same applies to developing countries such as Vietnam, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, Bangladesh, China, Iran, and India. For the developed countries, Canada and Turkey, the influence of AI-based innovation on SDG3 is projected to significantly decrease in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then steadily increase between 2023 and 2024. Then, it is projected to drop significantly in 2025 before continuously increasing from 2026 to 2030.  4.4 SDG4 (quality education) related results SDG4 (Social Pillar) stands for quality education. Over the past decade, school enrollment, especially for girls, has increased. Nonetheless, in 2018, nearly 20Â % of the world's youth were out of school. The global pandemic has also threatened global education progress (United Nations, 2022d ). Table 5 in the Appendix shows how AI-based innovation affected SDG4. The impact of AI-based innovation on SDG4 is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then increase continuously between 2023 and 2030 for developed nations such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. The same applies to developing countries such as Vietnam, Uzbekistan, Egypt, Bangladesh, and Iran. For the developed country, the USA, the influence of AI-based innovation on SDG4 is projected to drop continuously between 2021 and 2030. On the other hand, France, Japan, China, and Kenya are projected to show an increase-decrease trend. Moreover, the USA, Turkey, India, Pakistan, and Nigeria are expected to show a decrease-increase-decrease trend, while Germany will have a decrease-increase-decrease-increase trend.  4.5 SDG5 (gender equality) related results Gender equality is required for stability, prosperity, and sustainable development. In the last few decades, there has been a rise in the education of young women, a decline in the practice of early marriage, an increase in the number of powerful women in positions of authority, and the passing of legislation to further advance gender equality. There are still many obstacles to overcome, despite these advances. In 2019, one in every five women and girls between the ages of 15 and 49 experienced physical or sexual abuse at the hands of an intimate partner, discriminatory legislation and societal norms persisted, and women were underrepresented at every level of government. COVID-19 further exacerbated gender disparities in terms of security, the economy, and social protection (United Nations, 2022c ). Table 6 in the Appendix summarizes the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG5. From Table 6, it is evident that the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG5 (Gender Equality) is anticipated to increase continuously between 2021 and 2030 for the developed nations of Japan and Russia. The same applies to developing countries such as China and Pakistan. For developed nations such as Australia, the USA, the UK, the UAE, Canada, France, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG5 is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then increase continuously between 2023 and 2030. The same applies to developing countries such as India, Bangladesh, Kenya, Egypt, and Iran. Nigeria (a developing country), Uzbekistan (a developing country), and Germany (a developed country) are projected to witness Decrease-Increase, Decrease-Increase-Decrease-Increase, and Increase-Decrease-Increase trends, respectively.  4.6 SDG6 (clean water and sanitation) related results Despite progress, a billion peopleâmostly ruralâlack clean water and sanitation. One in three people lack safe drinking water, two in five lack soap and water for handwashing, and over 673 million defecate in the open (United Nations, 2022b ). Table 7 in the Appendix presents the results of the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG6 (Environmental Pillar). From Table 7, it is evident that the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) is anticipated to increase continuously between 2021 and 2030 for the developed nations of Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. The same applies to developing countries such as Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, and Pakistan. On the other hand, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG6 is anticipated to decrease continuously between 2021 and 2030 for the developed nation of Canada. The same applies to the developing country Uzbekistan. For developing nations such as Vietnam, Kenya, Bangladesh, China, and India, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG6 is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then increase continuously between 2023 and 2030. On the other hand, for developed nations such as the UK and Turkey, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG6 is anticipated to increase significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then decrease continuously between 2023 and 2030. In New Zealand (a developed country), the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG6 is forecast to remain unchanged between 2021 and 2030. In the USA (a developed country), the influence of AI-based innovation on SDG6 is projected to see a steady increase from 2022 to 2027, compared to the base year of 2021, then a slight drop in 2028, followed by another steady increase from 2029 to 2030.  4.7 SDG7 (affordable and clean energy) related results By improving energy efficiency, renewable energy, and electricity for developing countries, Goal 7 is being accomplished. Nonetheless, more effort is required to electrify Sub-Saharan Africa, boost access to clean and safe cooking methods and fuels for the world's 3 billion people who lack them, and diversify renewable energy sources beyond electricity (United Nations, 2022c ). Table 8 in the Appendix shows how AI-based innovation affects SDG7 (Environmental Pillar). Table 8 shows that the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) is anticipated to increase continuously between 2021 and 2030 for the developed nations of France, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, and the USA. On the other hand, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG7 is anticipated to decrease continuously between 2021 and 2030 for the developing nation of Egypt. For developing nations such as Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Kenya, Bangladesh, China, and India, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG7 is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then increase continuously between 2023 and 2030. The same is true for developed nations such as the UK, Australia, Japan, Germany, and Turkey. On the other hand, for Russia (a developed country), the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG7 is anticipated to increase significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then decrease continuously between 2023 and 2030. Pakistan (a developing country) and Canada (a developed country) are projected to witness an Increase-Decrease trend. On the other hand, it is anticipated that the UAE, Iran, and Nigeria will witness an increase-decrease-increase trend.  4.8 SDG8 (decent work and economic growth) related results A global recession worse than in 2009 in the aftermath of COVID-19 is forecast by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The ILO estimates that nearly half of the global workforce may lose their jobs (United Nations, 2022c ). Under this circumstance, inclusive economic growth is needed to boost living standards, jobs, and progress. Table 9 in the Appendix shows how AI-based innovation affects SDG8 (Economic Pillar). From Table 9, it is evident that the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) is anticipated to increase continuously between 2021 and 2030 for the developed nations of France and New Zealand. For developing nations such as Uzbekistan, Nigeria, Iran, Egypt, Kenya, Bangladesh, and China, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG8 is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then increase continuously between 2023 and 2030. The same is true for developed nations such as the UAE, Russia, the UK, Germany, and Turkey. On the other hand, for Saudi Arabia (a developed country), the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG8 is anticipated to increase significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then decrease continuously between 2023 and 2030. In Australia (a developed country), the influence of AI-based innovation on SDG8 is projected to see a steady increase from 2022 to 2026, compared to the base year of 2021, followed by a steep drop in 2027 and another steady increase from 2028 to 2030. On the other hand, it is anticipated that the USA, Japan, Canada, and Vietnam will witness a Decrease-Increase-Decrease-Increase trend. Similarly, India and Pakistan are forecast to witness Decrease-Increase-Decrease and Decrease-Increase trends, respectively.  4.9 SDG10 (reduced inequalities) related results Even though some countries have lower relative income inequality and lower-income countries have preferential trade status, inequality persists. COVID-19 has worsened inequalities, especially for the poor and vulnerable, highlighting economic inequality and fragile social safety nets (United Nations, 2022d ). Table 10 in the Appendix presents the results for the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG10 (Social Pillar). From Table 10, it is evident that the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG10 (Reduced Inequalities) is anticipated to increase continuously between 2021 and 2030 for the developed nation of Japan. On the other hand, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG10 is anticipated to decrease continuously between 2021 and 2030 for Australia, Germany, New Zealand, Egypt, and India. For developing nations such as Nigeria, Kenya, and China, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG10 is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then increase continuously between 2023 and 2030. The same is true for developed nations such as France, Canada, Russia, and the UAE. On the other hand, for Turkey, Bangladesh, and Iran, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG10 is anticipated to increase significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then decrease continuously between 2023 and 2030. In Saudi Arabia (a developed country), the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG10 is forecast to remain unchanged between 2021 and 2030. It is anticipated that the USA and the UK will witness an âIncrease-Decrease-Increase- Decreaseâ trend. On the other hand, Uzbekistan and Pakistan are forecast to witness a Decrease-Increase-Decrease trend. Similarly, Vietnam is forecast to witness a âDecrease-Increaseâ trend.  4.10 SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities) related results Cities and metropolitan areas drive 60Â % of global GDP and produce 70Â % of carbon emissions. Rapid urbanization is leading to more slum dwellers, overburdened infrastructure and services, and worsening air pollution. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) warns that without measures to feed poor and vulnerable urban residents, hunger and fatalities could rise significantly (United Nations, 2022d ). Table 11 in the Appendix presents the results for the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG11 (Social Pillar). Table 11 shows that the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) is anticipated to increase continuously between 2021 and 2030 for Canada, the USA, and India. On the other hand, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG11 is anticipated to decrease continuously between 2021 and 2030 for the developing nation of Uzbekistan. For developing nations such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kenya, and China, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG11 is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then increase continuously between 2023 and 2030. The same is true for developed nations such as Australia, New Zealand, Russia, and the UAE. On the other hand, for the UK, Germany, Turkey, Nigeria, and Iran, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG11 is anticipated to face an âincrease-decreaseâ trend, whereas Japan and Saudi Arabia are forecast to show a âdecrease-increaseâ trend, Egypt a âdecrease-increase-decrease-increaseâ trend, and France a âdecrease-increase-decreaseâ trend.  4.11 SDG12 (responsible consumption and production) related results Incessant consumption and production continue to harm the environment. In the past 100Â years, economic and social progress has gone hand in hand with environmental damage, putting at risk the systems on which our future growth and survival depend (United Nations, 2022d ). Table 12 in the Appendix shows how AI-based innovation affects SDG12 (Environmental Pillar). Table 12 shows that the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG12 (Responsible Production and Consumption) is anticipated to decrease continuously between 2021 and 2030 for Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Egypt, China, Saudi Arabia, and Uzbekistan. For the developing nation of Vietnam, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG12 is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then increase continuously between 2023 and 2030. On the other hand, for France, Turkey, the USA, the UK, the UAE, India, Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, and Iran, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG12 is anticipated to increase significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then decrease continuously between 2023 and 2030.  4.12 SDG13 (actions to combat climate change) related results The 2015 Paris Agreement set a limit of 2Â Â°C for the increase in global temperature this century. Through financial flows, new technology frameworks, and improved capacity building, the agreement also aims to help countries cope with climate change (United Nations, 2022c ). Table 13 in the Appendix shows how AI-based innovation affects SDG13 (Environmental Pillar). Table 13 shows that the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG13 (Climate Action) is anticipated to increase continuously between 2021 and 2030 for France and Nigeria. On the other hand, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG13 is anticipated to decrease continuously between 2021 and 2030 for Uzbekistan, China, India, Kenya, and Pakistan. For Australia, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, Turkey, the UAE, the UK, the USA, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Vietnam, and Russia, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG13 is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then increase continuously between 2023 and 2030. On the other hand, for Bangladesh, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG13 is anticipated to increase significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then decrease continuously between 2023 and 2030. For Iran, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG13 is anticipated to face a âdecrease-increaseâ trend.  4.13 SDG14 (protecting and promoting sustainability for life below water) related results Sustainable futures require careful management of oceans and seas, which deliver and regulate our drinking water, rainwater, climate, weather, food, coastlines, and oxygen. Pollution degrades coastal waters, and ocean acidification harms ecosystems and biodiversity. Ocean conservation must continue by reducing overfishing and marine pollution (United Nations, 2022c ). Table 14 in the Appendix summarizes the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG14 (Environmental Pillar). Table 14 shows that the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG14 (Life Below Water) is anticipated to increase continuously between 2021 and 2030 for Germany, Iran, and Pakistan. On the other hand, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG14 is anticipated to decrease continuously between 2021 and 2030 for Uzbekistan, China, India, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. For the UK, the USA, and France, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG14 is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then increase continuously between 2023 and 2030. On the other hand, for Japan, Canada, and New Zealand, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG14 is anticipated to increase significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then decrease continuously between 2023 and 2030. For Russia, the UAE, and Bangladesh, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG14 is anticipated to face âincrease-decrease-increase-decrease-increase-decrease,â âincrease-decrease-increase-decrease-increase,â and âincrease-decrease-increase-decrease,â trends, respectively. On the other hand, Egypt and Kenya are forecast to face a âdecrease-increase-decreaseâ trend.  4.14 SDG15 (protecting life on land) related results Humans have modified nearly all of Earth' s surface, leaving less and less room for the planet' s natural inhabitants. It is estimated that one million species of animals and plants will become extinct in the next century. Radical shifts are required to preserve and revive the natural world (United Nations, 2022d ). The effects of AI-based innovation on SDG15 (Environmental Pillar) are summarized in Table 15 in the Appendix. Table 15 shows that the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG15 (Life on Land) is anticipated to increase continuously between 2021 and 2030 for Australia, Canada, the UAE, the UK, and the USA. On the other hand, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG15 is anticipated to decrease continuously between 2021 and 2030 for Egypt, Pakistan, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. For France and Uzbekistan, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG15 is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and increase continuously between 2023 and 2030. On the other hand, for Bangladesh, China, India, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Nigeria, Turkey, and New Zealand, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG15 is anticipated to increase significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then decrease continuously between 2023 and 2030. For Germany and Vietnam, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG15 is anticipated to face âincrease-decrease-increase-decrease-increase,â and âdecrease-increaseâ trends, respectively.  4.15 SDG16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions) related results Conflict, weak institutions, insecurity, and injustice threaten sustainable development. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) registered a record 70 million refugees in 2018. The UN reported that 357 journalists, human rights defenders, and trade unionists were murdered, and 30 went missing in 47 nations in 2019. Currently, one in four under-5 children worldwide is unregistered, denying them a legal identity and access to justice and social services (United Nations, 2022b ). Table 16 in the Appendix shows how AI-based innovation affects SDG16 (Social Pillar). Table 16 shows that the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG16 (Peace, Justice, and Solid Institutions) is anticipated to increase continuously between 2021 and 2030 for Japan, Russia, and Turkey. On the other hand, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG16 is anticipated to decrease continuously between 2021 and 2030 for India. For France, Iran, China, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Vietnam, and Uzbekistan, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG16 is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and increase continuously between 2023 and 2030. On the other hand, for Bangladesh, the UK, Canada, the USA, Germany, and New Zealand, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG16 is anticipated to increase significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then decrease continuously between 2023 and 2030. Similarly, Kenya and Nigeria are forecast to face a âdecrease-increase-decreaseâ trend. For Australia, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG16 is anticipated to face an âincrease-decrease-increase-decreaseâ trend.  4.16 SDG17 (revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development) related results The COVID-19 pandemic might have caused the worst recession since the Great Depression, a 3Â % global economic contraction in 2020. SDG achievement requires strong international cooperation. SDG17 prefers AI-driven connections for problem-solving and SDG goals (United Nations, 2022a ). Table 17 in the Appendix shows how AI-based innovation affects SDG17 (Social Pillar). Table 17 indicates that the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG17 (Partnerships for the Goals) is anticipated to decrease continuously between 2021 and 2030 for Egypt. On the other hand, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG17 is anticipated to increase continuously between 2021 and 2030 in New Zealand. For Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Iran, China, Japan, Turkey, Nigeria, Pakistan, Vietnam, and Uzbekistan, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG17 is anticipated to decrease significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and increase continuously between 2023 and 2030. On the other hand, for Bangladesh and Kenya, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG17 is anticipated to increase significantly in 2022, compared to the base year of 2021, and then decrease continuously between 2023 and 2030. Similarly, the UK and the UAE are forecast to face an âincrease-decreaseâ trend. For the USA and Saudi Arabia, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG17 is anticipated to face âincrease-decrease-increase-decreaseâ and âincrease-decrease-increase,â trends, respectively. On the other hand, for Russia, the impact of AI-based innovation on SDG17 is anticipated to face a âdecrease-increase-decrease-increaseâ trend.   5 Findings and discussion 5.1 Main findings The widespread consensus is that AI and associated technologies, such as machine intelligence and big data, have revolutionized our present and future (Demiralay et al., 2021 ). According to numerous previous studies, AI is linked to education, employment, health care, utilities, and environmental protection (Amabile, 2020 ; Bag et al., 2021 ; FÃ¼ller et al., 2022 ). However, there are also concerns because, as anticipated, AI might outperform humans. Taking into account both these positive and negative aspects of AI (Lee et al., 2022 ), I created a model based on TEF (theoretical framework) to predict the effects of AI-based Innovation on SDGs using a System Dynamics Perspective in a cross-country setting. The results of hypotheses tests based on this model are summarized in Table 18 in the Appendix. When most of the 22 countries (except for a few) supported a hypothesis, a hypothesis is considered to be âsupported.â On the other hand, when only half of the countries supported a hypothesis, a hypothesis is considered to be âpartially supported.â Otherwise, a hypothesis is not supported. First, since 2022 was affected by COVID-19, I have considered it an exceptional case for all the SDGs' achievements. Goodell (2020)  supports this by arguing that the pandemic has sped up the adoption of AI and associated technologies in healthcare, education, and remote work, potentially alleviating poverty. Hence, I can conclude that H1a, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG1 (poverty reduction), is overall supported for both developed and developing countries. Countries are likely to perform better on SDG1 if they utilize free digital platforms for financial management, Accounting Information Systems for financial education, and AI for economic data analysis, challenging populist views that charity and wealth redistribution alone can alleviate poverty (Keding and Meissner, 2021 ). Nevertheless, developed countries are expected to perform better in achieving SDG1 than developing ones. Hence, H4a, which proposed that AI-based innovation helps developed countries achieve better results in SDG1 due to better institutional arrangements than developing countries, is overall supported. This is consistent with the findings of Benzidia et al. (2021) , who reported that AI-based innovation can mitigate poverty by boosting economic growth, generating jobs, and improving social welfare. Second, H1b, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) impacts positively on SDG2 (zero hunger), is supported by some developed (Australia, Germany, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE) and developing countries (e.g., Vietnam, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, Bangladesh, China, and India) based on 2023â2030 forecasting. The predicted success of these nations is due to regulations like food governance-related Agricultural Innovation Systems, healthy eating education, and risk warning systems (Keding and Meissner, 2021 ), aligning with the findings of Elsayed et al. (2020)  findings on AI's potential to enhance agricultural efficiency, safety, and productivity. Nonetheless, H1b is not supported for other developed (e.g., France, New Zealand, Turkey, USA, and UK) and developing countries (Iran), emphasizing the role of context-specific factors, such as access to affordable labor (Gupta et al., 2020 ). Hence, H1b is partially supported overall, and developing countries are anticipated to show better performance20  20 All developing countries except one are projected to show an increasing trend in the period considered.   in achieving SDG2 than developed countries. Hence, H4b, which proposed that AI-based innovation helps developed countries to achieve better results in SDG2 due to better institutional arrangements than developing countries, is not supported. This finding aligns with Zameer et al. (2020) , indicating that factors beyond institutional arrangements, such as resourceful innovative practices and comparative advantages like affordable labor, can also enable developing countries to achieve zero hunger. Third, H1c, indicating that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG3 (Good Health and Well-being), is corroborated by the estimated results for 2023â2030 for most developed and all developing countries. These countries leverage AI in medical prediction and diagnosis, healthcare training through VR, AR, and mobile apps, and use public digital apps to promote healthy habits and control infectious diseases, in line with the findings of Benzidia et al. (2021) . However, H1c is not supported in developed countries, Canada and Turkey. Hence, H1c is supported21  21 Only two developed countries did not support H1c.   overall, and developing countries are anticipated to show better performance22  22 All developing countries are projected to show an increasing trend in the period considered.   in achieving SDG3 compared to developed countries. Hence, H4c, which proposed that better institutional arrangements in developed countries help them perform better in achieving AI-based innovation and resultant better SDG3, is not wholly supported. This is consistent with the finding of Li et al. (2021)  that AI can improve healthcare in the resource-limited settings typically found in developing countries. Fourth, H2a, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG4 (quality education), is supported by the estimated results for 2023â2030 for some developed (e.g., Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE) and developing countries (e.g., Vietnam, Uzbekistan, Egypt, Bangladesh, and Iran). These countries employ advanced digital platforms, AI, and big data to enhance education access and quality, fostering personalized and inclusive learning, as supported by research illustrating AI's positive influence on learning outcomes (Benzidia et al., 2021 ; Grijalvo et al., 2022 ). Yet, H2a is not supported by other developed (e.g., Japan, Germany, Turkey, the USA, and France) and developing countries (Nigeria, China, India, Kenya, and Pakistan). Hence, H2a is partially supported. This aligns with Calabrese et al. (2023) , who found that AI-based education's effectiveness may depend on specific cultural and social contexts, as well as policy frameworks. These results show that developed and developing countries are expected to perform similarly in achieving SDG4. Hence, H4d, which proposed that AI-based innovation helps developed countries to achieve better results in SDG4 due to better institutional arrangements than developing countries, is not supported. This contradicts the research of FÃ¼ller et al. (2022) , arguing that developing countries might struggle to adopt and implement AI-based innovations due to weaker institutional capacities. Fifth, H2b, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG5 (gender equality), is supported by the estimated results for 2023â2030 for some developed (e.g., Japan, Russia, Australia, the USA, the UK, the UAE, Canada, France, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey) and developing countries (e.g., China, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Kenya, Egypt, and Iran). These findings add to a growing body of literature (e.g., Makridis and Han, 2021 ), highlighting the potential of AI-based innovation to promote gender equality and empower women and girls. These nations use AI with VR/AR to empower women and girls economically and emotionally. They have also created AI-powered platforms to monitor hiring and policymaking for sexism, and forums to discuss improving laws to protect women and girls (Makridis and Han, 2021 ). Still, H2b is not supported by other developed (e.g., Germany) and developing countries (e.g., Nigeria and Uzbekistan). Therefore, H2b is supported overall, as only three countries did not support the hypothesis. Moreover, since most developed countries are anticipated to show better performance in achieving SDG5 compared to developing countries, H4e, which proposed that the better institutional arrangements in developed countries help them perform better in achieving AI-based innovation and resultant better SDG5, is supported, overall. This aligns with the research of AlarcÃ³n and Cole (2019) , which noted higher gender equality achievement in developed countries compared to developing countries. Sixth, H3a, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG6 (clean water and sanitation for all), is supported by the estimated results for 2023â2030 for certain developed (e.g., Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE) and developing countries (e.g., Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Vietnam, Kenya, Bangladesh, China, and India). The findings of Kumar et al. (2021)  align with this, highlighting these countries' policies, such as managing water infrastructure using an Automatic Identification System (AIS), IoT for water installation monitoring, and big data for water usage analysis. Yet, H3a is not supported for other developed (e.g., the USA, Canada, UK, New Zealand, and Turkey) and developing countries (e.g., Uzbekistan). Thus, H3a is partially supported. Moreover, since developing countries are anticipated to show better performance in achieving SDG6 compared to developed countries, H4f, which proposed that better institutional arrangements in developed countries help them perform better in achieving AI-based innovation and resultant better SDG6, is not supported. This contradicts the research of Fuenfschilling and Binz (2018) , which reported that developed countries with better institutional arrangements typically demonstrate higher technology-based innovation and consequent better achievement in SDG6. Seventh, H3b, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG7 (affordable and clean energy), is supported by the estimated results for 2023â2030 for some developed (e.g., France, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, the UK, Australia, Japan, Germany, Turkey, and the USA) and developing countries (e.g., Egypt, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Kenya, Bangladesh, China, and India). This is consistent with the findings of Zhu et al. (2020) , who further state that countries are using blockchain technology to better monitor the return on investment in clean & renewable energy, automation to lower energy facility inspection costs, and digital educational platforms for alternative energy use. Nevertheless, H3b is not supported by other developed (e.g., Russia, Canada, and UAE) and developing countries (e.g., Pakistan, Iran, and Nigeria). Consequently, H3b is partially supported. Moreover, since both developed and developing countries are anticipated to show similar performance in achieving SDG7, H4g, which proposed that better institutional arrangements in developed countries help them perform better in achieving AI-based innovation and resultant better SDG7, is not supported. This contradicts the research of Makridis and Han (2021) , which states that better institutional quality, such as improved governance and regulation, contributes to superior SDG7 achievement in developed countries. Eighth, H1d, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG8 (decent work and economic growth), is supported by the estimated results for 2023â2030 for some developed (e.g., France, New Zealand, UAE, Russia, the UK, Germany, and Turkey) and developing countries (e.g., Uzbekistan, Nigeria, Iran, Egypt, Kenya, Bangladesh, and China). This is consistent with the findings of RodrÃ­guez-EspÃ­ndola et al. (2022) , who further state that these countries provide free platforms for professionals, independent contractors, and freelancers, creating new opportunities for decent work and economic growth. Still, H1d is not supported for other developed (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Australia, the USA, Japan, and Canada) and developing countries (e.g., Uzbekistan and Vietnam). Hence, H1d is partially supported. Moreover, since developing countries are anticipated to show better performance in achieving SDG8 compared to developed countries, H4h, which proposed that the better institutional arrangements in developed countries help them perform better in achieving AI-based innovation and resultant better SDG8, is not supported. This is consistent with the findings of Fuenfschilling and Binz (2018) , indicating a complex relationship between institutional arrangements and SDG8, and that better institutional arrangements in developed countries do not necessarily guarantee better performance in achieving decent work and economic growth. Ninth, H2c, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG10 (reduced inequality), is supported by the estimated results for 2023â2030 for some developed (e.g., Japan, France, Canada, Russia, and the UAE) and developing countries (e.g., Nigeria, Kenya, and China). This is in line with the findings of Garg et al. (2022) , who further state that these countries are consistently implementing measures such as accessible digital platforms for learning, smart territories to encourage citizens' participation in urban decisions, and interconnected Internet banking systems to combat digital and economic divides. Nevertheless, H2c is not supported by other developed (e.g., the USA, the UK, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Germany, New Zealand, Turkey) and developing countries (e.g., Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Bangladesh, Iran, and India). Thus, H2c is not supported overall, as most countries do not support the hypothesis. However, since developed countries are anticipated to show better performance in achieving SDG10 compared to developing countries, H4i, which proposed that the better institutional arrangements in developed countries help them perform better in achieving AI-based innovation and resultant better SDG10, is supported overall. ZallÃ© (2019)  supports this, suggesting that developed countries with superior institutional quality and efficient governance structures can implement policies and initiatives to reduce inequality through social welfare programs, progressive tax systems, and targeted interventions in marginalized communities. Tenth, H2d, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities), is supported by the estimated results for 2023â2030 for some developed (e.g., Canada, the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, and the UAE) and developing countries (e.g., India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kenya, and China). This is consistent with the findings of Ullah et al. (2021) , which highlight these countries' implementation of smart cities with IoT-backed action plans for urban emergencies and the use of urban data blockchain technologies for recovery contingencies. Nevertheless, H2d is not supported by other developed (e.g., the UK, Germany, and Turkey) and developing countries (e.g., Uzbekistan, Nigeria, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Iran). Hence, H2d is partially supported. However, since developed countries are anticipated to show better performance in achieving SDG11 compared to developing countries, H4j, which proposed that the better institutional arrangements in developed countries help them perform better in achieving AI-based innovation and resultant better SDG11, is supported overall. This is supported by Gupta et al. (2023) , who found that developed countries with strong institutional arrangements have better urban policies and governance structures, resulting in better outcomes in sustainable urban development. Eleventh, H3c, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG12 (responsible consumption and production), is supported by the estimated results for 2023â2030 for one developing country, namely, Vietnam. This is consistent with the findings of Wang et al. (2020) , who state that countries showing good scores in achieving SDG12 are implementing advice-rendering information systems for agricultural sustainability, environmental certification for global market supply, robotics for âvirtualâ experiments in manufacturing processes, big data for manufacturing and consumption patterns, and AI-based sensing. However, H3c is not supported for most other developed (e.g., Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, France, Turkey, the USA, the UK, the UAE, and Russia) and developing countries (e.g., Iran, India, Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Egypt, China, and Uzbekistan). Consequently, H3c is not supported. This is in line with the research by Dolezal and Novelli (2022) , who found that the relationship between AI and sustainable development is complex and context-specific, with mixed results across different countries. However, since developing countries are anticipated to show better performance in achieving SDG12 compared to developed countries, H4k, which proposed that the better institutional arrangements in developed countries help them perform better in achieving AI-based innovation and resultant better SDG12, is not supported. This is contradicted by the findings of Johansen and Vestvik (2020) , who found that developed countries tend to have better institutional arrangements for promoting innovation, including financial support for research and development, intellectual property protection, and policies that encourage responsible consumption and production. Twelfth, H3d, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG13 (climate action), is supported by the estimated results for 2023â2030 for some developed (e.g., France, Australia, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, Turkey, the UAE, the UK, the USA, Saudi Arabia, and Russia) and developing countries (e.g., Nigeria, Egypt, and Vietnam). As Kumar et al. (2020)  note, these countries utilize digital tools for environmental education, advanced AI for survival education, smart cities for pollution reduction, and AI with robotics for environmental monitoring. However, H3d is not supported by developing countries (e.g., Uzbekistan, China, India, Kenya, Bangladesh, Iran, and Pakistan). Hence, H3d is partially supported. This finding is consistent with other studies conducted by Di Vaio et al. (2020) , who also found challenges for developing countries in fully embracing AI-based innovation for sustainable development. Moreover, since developed countries are expected to outperform developing countries in achieving SDG13, H4l, which proposed that the better institutional arrangements in developed countries help them perform better in achieving AI-based innovation and resultant better SDG13, is supported. This is consistent with the findings of Johansen and Vestvik (2020) , who reported that institutional factors in developed countries, such as congenial government support, innovation policies, and intellectual property rights, significantly influence the successful implementation of AI-based innovation for climate action-related sustainable development. Thirteenth, H3e, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG14 (Life below water), is supported by the estimated results for 2023â2030 for some developed (e.g., Germany, the UK, the USA, and France) and developing countries (e.g., Iran, and Pakistan). This is in line with the findings of Wang et al. (2020) , who further state that these countries are using AI-based drones and IoT to expose predatory fishing and environmental damage (e.g., plastic dumped into the sea). Big data and AIS for research as well as marine resource protection, were other measures. However, H3e is not supported for other developed (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Russia, the UAE, and Turkey) and developing countries (e.g., Uzbekistan, China, India, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Egypt, and Kenya). Thus, H3e is not supported, as most countries do not support this hypothesis. This finding is in line with previous research (e.g., Johansen and Vestvik, 2020 ) that noted the challenges in achieving SDG14, particularly in developing countries where there may be limited resources and institutional arrangements. Moreover, since developed and developing countries are forecast to show almost similar performance in achieving SDG14, H4m, which proposed that better institutional arrangements in developed countries help them achieve better AI-based innovation and resultant better SDG14, is not supported. Gupta et al. (2023)  corroborate these findings, stating that developing countries are progressing towards SDG14 despite the challenges, with technology transfer and capacity building playing crucial roles in promoting sustainable development. Fourteenth, H3f, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG15 (Life on land), is supported by the estimated results for 2023â2030 for some developed (e.g., Australia, Canada, the UAE, the UK, France, and the USA) and developing countries (e.g., Uzbekistan). This corroborates the findings by Kazancoglu et al. (2021) , who further state that these nations are using AI to optimize plantation-related water consumption and IoT-enabled smart sensors for real-time detection. They use aerial imagery and robotics to detect crop diseases and early fires using machine learning. Nevertheless, H3f is not supported for other developed (e.g., Japan, Germany, Russia, Turkey, New Zealand, and Saudi Arabia) and developing countries (e.g., Vietnam, Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, India, Iran, Kenya, and Nigeria). Consequently, H3f is not supported, as most countries do not support this hypothesis. However, since developed countries are anticipated to show better performance in achieving SDG15 than developing countries, H4n, which proposed that the better institutional arrangements in developed countries help them perform better in achieving AI-based innovation and resultant better SDG15, is supported. This aligns with previous research that indicates that (developed) countries with better institutional arrangements tend to perform better in achieving the sustainable coexistence of plants and animals on land through smart utilization of AI-based innovation compared to developing countries (Yin et al., 2022 ). Fifteenth, H2e, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), is supported by the estimated results for 2023â2030 for some developed (e.g., France, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Japan, Russia, and Turkey) and developing countries (e.g., Iran, China, Egypt, Pakistan, Vietnam, and Uzbekistan). This is consistent with the findings of Klofsten et al. (2019) , who further state that these nations are implementing digital educational platforms and integrated digital criminal evidence systems, and using AI in conjunction with drones, IoT, and blockchain to create integrated crime-fighting tools and combat institutional corruption. Nevertheless, H2e is not supported by other developed (e.g., Australia, the UK, Canada, the USA, Germany, and New Zealand) and developing countries (e.g., India, Bangladesh, Kenya, and Nigeria). Therefore, H2e is partially supported. However, since developing countries are anticipated to show better performance in achieving SDG16 than developed countries, H4o, which proposed that the better institutional arrangements in developed countries help them perform better in achieving AI-based innovation and resultant better SDG16, is not supported. This is supported by some recent literature (e.g., Chimhowu et al., 2019 ) finding that developing countries may outperform developed countries in achieving SDG16, despite having comparatively weaker institutional arrangements. Sixteenth, H2f, which proposed that AI-based innovation (SDG9) positively influences SDG17 (partnerships for the goals), is supported by the estimated results for 2023â2030 for some developed (e.g., New Zealand, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and Turkey) and developing countries (e.g., India, Iran, China, Nigeria, Pakistan, Vietnam, and Uzbekistan). This parallels the study by Klofsten et al. (2019) , who state that these nations use virtual platforms for planning innovation, VR/AR for educational and international alliances, and AI with big data for national development. Nevertheless, H2f is not supported by developed (e.g., Russia, the USA, Saudi Arabia, the UK, and the UAE) and developing countries (e.g., Egypt, Bangladesh, and Kenya). Hence, H2f is partially supported. Nevertheless, since developing countries are anticipated to show better performance in achieving SDG17 than developed countries, H4p, which proposed that the better institutional arrangements in developed countries help them perform better in achieving AI-based innovation and resultant better SDG17, is not supported. This is supported by the findings of Chimhowu et al. (2019) , who state that AI-based innovation can help to identify gaps in existing partnerships, highlight areas for potential collaboration, and facilitate the sharing of information and resources among stakeholders.  5.2 Contributions and implications to research 5.2.1 Theoretical contributions This paper makes several theoretical contributions by addressing the research gap articulated in the introduction. First, this study used Fountain's (2001)  TEF model to examine how institutional, organizational, technical, and situational variables affect SDG attainment across countries. As part of that model, this paper demonstrates the impact of particular institutional arrangements and organizational structures on the consequent technology's characteristics (enacted technologies). The paper demonstrates the dynamic relationships between implemented technology (innovation), organizational forms (AI adoption), and institutional arrangements (country-specific contextual factors). In the current model (theory), technology enactments (innovation) are created through a dynamic process in which organizational characteristics (AI adoption) or the presence of valid formal procedures (institutional arrangements) may either facilitate or impede a given enactment (characteristics of the technology). Along these lines, the study's key findings appear to be consistent with what many consider to be the need to integrate innovation with essential complementary resources (such as AI) to increase the value of these technologies in achieving sustainability (Bag et al., 2021 ). Hence, this study's key theoretical contribution is to extend TEF to demonstrate the coexistence of AI and creativity in accomplishing SDGs. As a result, this study's most significant theoretical contribution is to present an extension of TEF that illustrates the co-existence of AI and innovation in accomplishing SDGs. Secondly, although the roles played by these constructs may vary depending on the context and each of these constructs has been studied separately in the past, studying their interaction is novel and makes a substantial contribution to the existing literature on AI, Innovation, Sustainable Development, System Dynamics, SDGs, and the TEF literature. It is worth mentioning that examining any of these constructs independently may result in a limited comprehension of the SDG achievement process as a whole, as per prior research (Luna-Reyes and Gil-Garcia, 2011 ; Malodia et al., 2021 ). Thirdly, this study also adds to the existing literature on AI, Innovation, and SDGs by fostering fresh viewpoints on the impact of AI-based innovation on SDGs at different levels. At the 1st level, the direct impact of innovation on SDGs was investigated. At the 2nd level, the âenabling effectsâ of AI on innovation were investigated in its causal impact on SDGs. At the 3rd level, the long-term impact of AI-based innovation on SDGs was estimated. Also, this study makes an original contribution to the SDG and sustainability literature by examining the intricate relationship between SDG9 (innovation-related SDG) and the other SDGs. Fourthly, the paper proposes a comprehensive model that integrates the effects of AI-based innovation on SDGs using a system dynamics perspective. This model takes into account the complex interconnections and feedback loops between various aspects of AI-based innovation and SDGs, which have not previously been explored in a systematic way. Fifthly, this study also enhances the literature on system dynamics by exploring how Systems Dynamics can be employed for forecasting complex problems of interaction between AI, innovation, and SDGs for around a decade for 22 different nations covering five different continents. In fact, this paper combines institutional theory (Technology Enactment Framework) and system dynamics to explain complex SDG achievement. Very few previous studies have utilized this methodology. This is another contribution of this paper. Sixthly, this whole analysis has been done from a comparative perspective between developed and developing countries. Therefore, it contributes to the literature relating to developed and developing countries. Finally, this research combines institutional theory (technology enactment framework) with simulations based on system dynamics to better understand SDG phenomena. Institutional theory is strong, but its theoretical abstraction has questioned its application. Institutional theory and system dynamics may help researchers precisely define variables and hypothesized linkages. Mathematical accuracy in computer simulation requires variables to be conceptually and theoretically operationalized to develop a system dynamics model. Thus, institutional theory's complexity and critical notions are explored, while the approach's capacity to operationalize and interpret them concretely is retained. As previously stated, the simulation model may be regarded as a theory and assessed for internal consistency.  5.2.2 Practical implications The paper makes several practical contributions. First, although the SDGs (which represent an economic opportunity worth 12 trillion dollars) promise improved financial performance, it can be complicated to make the goals tangible at the business level because of the sheer magnitude of the SDGs (United Nations, 2022a ). If used wisely, AI-based innovation can provide businesses with the foundation for the prioritization of SDGs and enable them to translate global goals down to an organizational level (Lee et al., 2022 ). Second, this study elucidates the need for collaboration among academia, industry, and government for SDG-supporting technology advances to meet the SDG 2030 objective. I emphasize the importance of these players making more investments in AI-driven innovation and giving access to high-quality data for this purpose. Cleaner manufacturing is particularly vital for sustainable economic and environmental reasons. Third, the study highlights the need for continued investment in AI research and development to spur innovation for the SDGs. Accordingly, governments should allocate resources for developing AI technologies relevant to their specific SDG-related challenges. Fourth, Governments can invest in capacity-building programs to develop the skills needed to harness the potential of AI for the SDGs. This will ensure they have the expertise to develop and implement AI-driven solutions effectively. Fifth, Governments can use the model presented in the study to monitor and evaluate the impact of AI-driven innovations on the SDGs. This will help to identify areas that require improvement and guide the development of more effective measures. Sixth, the model uses a cross-country setting, indicating that the impact of AI-driven innovations on SDGs is not limited to one country. Decision-makers should use this insight to compare their country's progress against other countries and identify priority areas for improvement. Governments should also collaborate with other countries to share best practices, experiences, and innovations in AI-driven sustainable development. Seventh, the study emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making in achieving the SDGs. Governments can use the model's predictions and recommendations to make informed decisions backed by data and evidence.  5.2.3 Policy implications The paper makes several policy contributions. First, the study demonstrates the potential of AI-based innovations in achieving the SDGs. Governments can use this information to integrate AI-driven solutions into national development plans. This can help to identify the need for resources for implementing AI-driven innovations that will significantly impact on the SDGs. Second, the paper's model provides decision-makers with a fact-based assessment of the impact of AI-based innovation on SDGs. This can help associated governments in 22 countries establish efficient long-term policies and measures for sustainable development in the economic, social, and environmental domains. This can help to identify potential challenges and opportunities for different countries and develop targeted policies and interventions addressing their needs. Third, policymakers can use the model to identify and prioritize the most promising AI-driven innovations based on their potential to contribute to the SDGs. Fourth, the paper can help policymakers and entrepreneurs interested in creating new markets for SDG-related products, such as electricity, agriculture, legal, social, and urban services. The study provides insights into the potential impact of AI-based innovation on these sectors and can help experts prioritize their investments in these areas. Fifth, this study can also be used as a reference by policymakers to help them plan their new AI investments more effectively and spur more innovation for the SDGs. Sixth, the findings of this study can help policymakers and entrepreneurs identify new opportunities for collaboration in terms of AI-based innovation in the field of sustainable development in various developed and developing nations.  5.2.4 Social implications Since AI-related concerns are both complex and multidimensional, the findings of this study are consistent with the idea and context of âAI for Good.â Therefore, the study's predictions suggest that we should use AI to improve people's lives and reduce inequalities. All sustainable development initiatives should have human survival and growth as their end goal. Using the SDGs as a framework for understanding sustainable development, it has been demonstrated that linking AI-based innovation to the SDGs can shed light on solving the significant challenges faced by AI, such as ensuring the safety and dignity of individuals. In terms of obvious global concerns, the World Economic Forum has identified cybersecurity as a top concern (World Economic Forum, 2020 ). As a result of this research, policymakers in newly industrialized and democratic societies in developing nations may focus on transparency, ethics, and full citizen involvement as cornerstones of effective AI governance. The SDGs are based on universal principles like diversity, inclusion, and âleaving no one behind,â and my findings align with those principles.   5.3 Limitations and avenues for further research The study has certain limitations, which suggest avenues for future research. First, because the results are predicted using a simulation model, the SD method used for prediction has some flaws. This study's findings should, therefore, be interpreted in light of prior research on the topic. Future studies should also use empirical research to obtain factual results. Second, due to its 22-country sample size, this research has some limitations. Thus, to better understand AI-driven innovations, I recommend replicating them in other countries, especially those with less SDG effort, in future studies. Third, the study is conducted across different countries with varying levels of development and political systems. Hence, it may be difficult to generalize the results to other countries or regions. Future research can concentrate on specific nations and evaluate the effect of AI-based innovation on achieving SDGs in the local context in greater detail. Fourth, the study only considers the impact of AI-based innovation on SDGs at the macro-level, and future research should consider exploring the impact at the micro-level, such as the effects on individual households and communities. Fifth, the results of using AI-driven innovation to implement the SDG 2030 Agenda may seem too ambitious without input from other sources, like qualitative research with developers and experts of AI-driven innovation or focus groups where policymakers talk about these results. Future studies should capture the aforementioned qualitative insights. Sixth, I have not considered organizational forms, institutional arrangements, enacted technologies and outcomes' recursive relationships. Future studies exploring the interaction between AI, innovation, and SDGs should explore these recursive relationships. In other words, future research should consider exploring how SDGs can drive AI-based innovation and what the potential barriers are to this relationship. Seventh, future research should consider the interdependence of SDGs and how the impact of AI-based innovation on one SDG can affect others.
