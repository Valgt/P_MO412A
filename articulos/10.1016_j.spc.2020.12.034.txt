                  In addition to driving mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change mitigation actions can deliver non-climate benefits (co-benefits) but can also have adverse side-effects, working counter to other development objectives. Co-impacts assessment seeks to identify these co-benefits and adverse side-effects. Understanding of co-impacts can provide the knowledge base to garner support for mitigation actions, and to plan interventions that realize synergistic opportunities and contribute simultaneously to multiple objectives, increasing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of climate actions. However, the value of this information is determined by the manner in which it is framed and communicated.
                  In this paper, the relationships between climate change mitigation action and co-impacts and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are explored and illustrated using a selection of examples from countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We suggest that in the context of SDGs, the co-benefits approach could provide a cohesive framing to incentivize stakeholders to work together to garner support for ambitious policy which simultaneously achieves climate change mitigation and non-climate objectives. Similarly, understanding of adverse side-effects can help to ensure that trade-offs with delivery of the SDGs arising from mitigation actions are recognised and minimised. We note that the best way of framing these concepts is context and application specific.

Table 3:     Types of Co-impacts Examples of co-benefits Examples of adverse side effects Examples of potentially relevant SDG indicators   I. Climate resilience Reduced demand for primary energy supply achieved through energy efficiency can lead to lower vulnerability of energy systems to climate change (A) Integrated planning of urban systems and infrastructure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can increase climate resilience, such as planting trees to reduce urban heat islands (C) Mitigation actions in the AFOLU sector can support biodiversity and ecosystem integrity, reduce erosion and increase soil organic matter, thereby increasing climate resilience (D) Distributed renewable energy infrastructure is less vulnerable to climate impacts than large centralised infrastructure (E) Introduction of irrigation to address increasingly variable rainfall increases vulnerability to long term drought due to groundwater depletion (D)  Intensification of agricultural production systems reduces soil organic matter, which reduces water holding capacity and therefore drought tolerance (D) 7.3.1 Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP  7.1.2 Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology 13.1.1 Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population 13.1.3 Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies   II. Energy security Energy efficiency results in a lower demand to achieve the same productive energy and hence improves energy security (A)  Renewable energy reduces requirements for fossil inputs which may be in finite supply, imported, and/or vulnerable to policy, legislation and penalties on fossil fuels. Local generation of renewable energy can contribute to greater energy security for a country or region (B) Food production technologies with lower direct GHG emissions, such as cellular agriculture and controlled environment agriculture, can have a higher energy demand and thereby add pressure on renewable energy sources (D) 7.1.2 Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology  7.2.1 Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption 7.3.1 Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP   III. Investment, growth More efficient energy use, switching to more efficient and locally sourced fuels and renewable energy options can be linked to greater resource efficiency and lower productive energy costs, and thus can have positive economic growth outcomes (A, B, E) Depending on the application, switching to alternative fuels, alternative feedstocks and new processes may require significant technology development, high capital inputs and be more expensive, resulting in negative impacts on investment and growth (B, F, G) 8.2.1 Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person  8.4.1 Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP 10.1.1 Growth rates of household expenditure or income per capita amongst the bottom 40 per cent of the population and the total population 17.3.1 Foreign direct investments (FDI), official development assistance and South-South Cooperation as a proportion of total domestic budget  IV. Employment Job opportunities can be created in energy efficiency, AFOLU and renewable energy actions (A, D, E) Job losses can be experienced during the transition to increased efficiency, alternative fuels and processing routes (A, B, D, E, G). The growing literature on “just transitions” describes this concern in the energy sector Reducing deforestation could lead to reduced employment opportunities to those dependant on firewood for sale (D) 8.3.1 Proportion of informal employment in non-agriculture employment, by sex 8.5.2 Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities.  8.6.1 Proportion of youth (aged 15–24 years) not in education, employment or training  8.b.1 Total government spending in social protection and employment programmes as a proportion of the national budgets and GDP  V. Biodiversity, ecosystem services, soil Many alternative fuels, various actions in the AFOLU sector and renewable energy options require lower inputs of primary resources and thus have a lower impact on biodiversity, ecosystem services and soil (BDE) Some agricultural intensification methods have lower GHG emission intensities but reduce biodiversity through increased use of agrichemicals and synthetic fertiliser, and increased pressure on the natural resource base; introduction of irrigation can lead to salinization (D) Expansion of energy crops could impact biodiversity if it results in deforestation and reduce soil fertility if it intensifies biomass removal (E) 2.4.1 Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture  5.a.1 (a) Official development assistance on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; and (b) revenue generated and finance mobilized from biodiversity-relevant economic instruments 15.3.1 Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area     VI. Water pollution Alternative fuels, feedstocks and processes, various actions in the AFOLU sector and renewable energy options such as wind and solar PV may require lower water inputs and give rise to lower pollutant loads than the options they are replacing (BEDFG) Many food system mitigation actions, including a shift to a larger share of plant-based food, reduce the demand for water for irrigated feedstock crops, as well as the overall need for fertilizers for animal feed production and thus the pressure on water bodies through runoff/leaching of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds (D) Although alternative industrial feedstocks and processes may be less GHG intensive than current options, there is potential for greater water pollutant impacts (F, G)  Low- and no-tillage technologies increase the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural soils, but might require higher herbicide applications to counter weed problems (D) 6.1.1 Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services  6.2.1 Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water 6.3.1 Proportion of domestic and industrial wastewater flows safely treated  6.5.1 Degree of integrated water resources management  VII. Air pollution Alternative fuels, feedstocks and processes, and renewable energy options can reduce air pollutant loads compared with fossil fuels (BEFG) Many food system mitigation actions, including a shift to a larger share of plant-based food, also reduce the need for fertilizers in animal feed production and thus ammonia volatilisation (D) Although alternative feedstocks and processes may be less GHG intensive than current options, there is potential for greater local air pollutant impacts. An example is vehicles running on diesel produced from fossil fuels, which have lower GHGs but higher local air pollutants than petroleum vehicles or switching from petroleum to ethanol which may increase ozone pollution (F, G) 3.9.1 Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution 11.6.2 Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted) 12.4.2 Hazardous waste generated per capita and proportion of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment  VIII. Energy access Energy efficiency, alternative fuels and renewable options can provide affordable and reliable energy supply to areas that are both currently served and unserved with electricity and other energy carriers (ABE) Sustainable harvesting of forestry resources can contribute to energy access in communities reliant on these sources for supply (E) Reducing forest degradation and controlling illegal logging and land clearing could lead to reduced incomes and increased hardship for communities dependant on these activities (D) 7.1.1 Proportion of population with access to electricity  7.2.1 Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption   IX.

Editor: Prof. Adisa Azapagic In addition to driving mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change mitigation actions can deliver non-climate benefits (co-benefits) but can also have adverse side-effects, working counter to other development objectives. Co-impacts assessment seeks to identify these co-benefits and adverse side-effects. Understanding of co-impacts can provide the knowledge base to garner support for mitigation actions, and to plan interventions that realize synergistic opportunities and contribute simultaneously to multiple objectives, increasing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of climate actions. However, the value of this information is determined by the manner in which it is framed and communicated. In this paper, the relationships between climate change mitigation action and co-impacts and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are explored and illustrated using a selection of examples from countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We suggest that in the context of SDGs, the co-benefits approach could provide a cohesive framing to incentivize stakeholders to work together to garner support for ambitious policy which simultaneously achieves climate change mitigation and non-climate objectives. Similarly, understanding of adverse side-effects can help to ensure that trade-offs with delivery of the SDGs arising from mitigation actions are recognised and minimised. We note that the best way of framing these concepts is context and application specific.   Keywords Mitigation  Adaptation  Sustainable development goals  SDGs  Co-impacts    1 Introduction Over recent years, a body of literature has been developed which focuses on the co-impacts of climate change mitigation actions. The term co-impacts is used here to refer to both the additional benefits that can be achieved through implementing actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (or co-benefits), and the negative impacts where mitigation action works counter to other developmental objectives (or adverse side-effects). It has been widely argued that co-impacts assessment is critical to support decisions on mitigation actions, and that targeting multiple co-benefits can help to identify synergies and increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of interventions (Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2014 ; Karlsson et al., 2020 ; McElwee et al. 2020 ; Cowie et al., 2007 ; Smith et al. 2020 ). An understanding of adverse side effects allows for the opportunity to minimise negative impacts or otherwise manage the trade-offs where they are inevitable. With the global focus on attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there is a greater need to identify policy interventions that have multiple benefits for climate and other developmental objectives, to both obtain support for, and ensure optimization of, policies, projects and programmes, particularly in developing countries. This paper explores the links between climate change mitigation and the SDGs. It begins by presenting a brief overview of climate change mitigation co-impacts, and current thinking around its value in driving mitigation action. It then draws on a selection of countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to provide some examples of co-benefits and adverse side effects resulting from mitigation actions in different sectors, and maps these to the SDGs. Finally, perspectives are provided on the value of this mapping in supporting both climate and development action.  2 Potential co-impacts of climate change mitigation actions Addressing the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation challenge requires a wide range of technology and policy responses across the sectors (see Table 1  ). Much literature has focused on the extent to which such responses can reduce GHG emissions, and their cost (Karlsson et al., 2020 ). Identification and assessment of co-benefits of climate mitigation actions, which differ depending on the context in which the mitigation actions are implemented, can serve as leverage for securing financial support for implementation of options promising the highest net societal benefit, and provide a basis to balance short- and long-term benefits and obtain stakeholder buy-in. Assessment of adverse side effects on the other hand can help to avoid negative impacts of mitigation, and support policy and decision makers in making informed trade-offs between climate and other objectives (Bhardwaj et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2019; Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2014 ). For example, trade-offs and synergies between universal electricity access and decarbonisation of energy supply are documented (Dagnachew et al., 2018 ), as are synergies and trade-offs across land-use options in terms of increasing carbon stocks, protecting biodiversity and contributing to food security (Fujimori et al., 2018; Galik et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2018, 2020 ; Fujimori et al., 2018 ). Other terms are also used in the literature. The term co-impacts has been proposed to capture both the co-benefits and adverse side-effects of policies. An alternative framing is one of multiple objectives, where climate change mitigation is placed alongside other objectives when assessing policy decisions (Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2014 ; Bhardwaj et al., 2019 ; Mayrhofer and Gupta 2016 ; Cohen et al., 2017 ). Various authors have presented proposals for categorising co-impacts in specific contexts, towards supporting standardised analyses and more robust comparison between studies (Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2014 ; Raymond et al., 2017 ; Baumber et al., 2019 ). Standardised quantification of co-benefits, and the analysis, presentation and utilisation of the information, however, remain a challenge (Cohen et al., 2019; Floater et al., 2016; Mayrhofer and Gupta, 2016; Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2014; Zurek, 2018 ; Zurek et al. 2018 ). In some cases, the approach taken is to monetise all co-impacts, although there are controversies around such framing, based on the uncertain and limited availability of valuation techniques and context specificity of indicators and benefits (Balouktsi 2019 ). The literature provides different perspectives on how the framing of co-impacts can support the adoption of climate change mitigation actions. Research has shown that a greater emphasis on the non-climate related benefits can motivate greater support for climate mitigation actions (Walker et al., 2018 ), and vice versa (Stanaway et al. 2018 ; Barker et al., 2007 ; Amann et al., 2011 ). The motivation for re-framing mitigation action in policy stems from the growing recognition that mitigationaction in most countries appears to be technically feasible, but is limited by political challenges (Kuzemko et al., 2016 ). These political challenges are attributed to limited public support, predominantly due to perceptions of the uncertainty of climate change impacts (Walker et al., 2018 ), the lack of immediate benefits to those enacting the mitigation action, as well astechnological and behavioural lock-in mechanisms (Seto et al., 2016 ). However, re-framing is not always successful, with some case studies demonstrating that focusing more on co-benefits than climate mitigation has not had the expected climate benefits, as the way in which data are processed by decision makers and other stakeholders depends on various factors including preconceptions and biases of recipient audiences (Bernauer and McGrath 2016 ; Walker et al., 2018 ). Local context and target audiences for information that is communicated thus need to be considered when developing and communicating new policies and interventions.  3 Linking mitigation action, co-benefits and the SDGs Coordinated integrated approaches to climate change mitigation policies, across sectors and policy areas and governance mechanisms, are required to maximise synergies and manage trade-offs (Pardoe et al., 2018 ; Cowie et al. 2018 ; Kugelberg et al., 2020 ). Such approaches are also called for in the context of cross-sectoral interactions between adaptation and mitigation measures, for example between the agriculture, conservation, forests, urban, water and energy sectors (Di Gregorio et al. 2017 ; Arent et al., 2014 ; Berry et al., 2015 ). Integrated planning and cross-sectoral alignment of climate change and development policies is already evident in developing countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) pledged under the Paris Agreement, where key priority sectors such as agriculture and energy are closely aligned in terms of mitigation and adaptation actions in the context of sustainable development and, in some cases, the SDGs (Antwi-Agyei et al., 2018 ; England et al., 2018 ). Examples of such alignments that are made explicit in a selection of countries’ NDCs is presented in Table 2  . Given the direct link between co-impacts and development, and some of the challenges associated with the communication and utilization of co-impacts information in supporting policy and decision making, and consequently in driving mitigation action, the framing of co-impacts in terms of the SDGs offers significant value. There is already a strong understanding that climate action is linked, both positively and negatively, with achieving many of the SDGs (Balouktsi 2019 ; Fuso Nerini et al. 2019 ; International Resource Panel, 2019 ; Smith et al., 2019 ; Vanham et al. 2019 ). Fig. 1   provides a visualisation of the links between emitting sectors, sectorally-relevant mitigation actions, co-impacts of mitigation actions and the SDGs (based on the mapping approach in (Smith et al. 2019 )). The inner circle represents the sectors in which mitigation occurs (i to vi). The second (blue) ring shows different types of mitigation actions (A to G), with the small roman numerals mapping the sectors onto the mitigation actions (see also Table 1 ). The third ring (green) is divided according to the different domains where co-impacts are observed, where I relates to the broad area of climate resilience, II-IV are economic, V-VII environmental, VIII-XII social, and XIII political and institutional co-impacts, with the classification adapted from (Mayrhofer and Gupta 2016 ). For each segment, the different types of climate related co-benefits (green letters) and adverse side effects (red letters) that can be achieved through mitigation action are shown. Selected examples of co-impacts that could be included in the third ring are shown in Table 3   . The final ring maps the different co-impact domains, shown in large roman numerals, to the SDGs. Also shown in Table 3  are examples of relevant SDG indicators that link to the co-benefits and adverse side effects. Whilst not exhaustive, a mapping such as that shown in Fig. 1 , and as reflected in the examples in Table 3 , is useful to facilitate discourse between policy, academic, advocacy and other communities focusing on mitigation, co-impacts and the SDGs, towards designing and raising support for both policy and practical interventions that maximise benefits, while understanding any trade-offs and allowing adverse side effects to be managed. Furthermore, such dialogue amongst diverse stakeholders can inform decisions about how to emphasise climate action relative to other sustainable development impacts in both communication and planning of mitigation actions, depending on the local context. The framing of co-benefits within the context of SDGs may thus be particularly useful for policymakers in developing countries where national circumstances require the prioritization of basic development objectives.  4 Concluding remarks Applying a co-impacts framing when examining climate change mitigation policies and actions has a number of advantages. Climate change decision making, particularly in developing countries, requires a comprehensive approach that accommodates intersecting developmental needs and ecological vulnerabilities. The co-benefits approach to climate change mitigation, seeking synergistic outcomes that meet multiple objectives, can address these needs and vulnerabilities across a variety of spatial and temporal scales and can be tailored to local contexts (Spencer et al. 2017 ; He et al., 2019 ; Karlsson et al., 2020 ). Similar considerations were the driving force behind the recent IPCC report on Climate Change and Land, leading to a co-benefits approach being taken in the synthesis chapter (Smith et al., 2020 ). This paper has highlighted that the case for linking climate change mitigation action and the co-benefits thereof, towards gathering increased support for action, is well established in the literature, with some further evidence showing that assessment of adverse side effects can avoid unintended consequences of action. Co-impacts arguments have been increasingly used in variety of climate change policy contexts, including those related to national development plans, NDCs, Biennial Update Reports to the UNFCCC (BURs), agriculture plans, and those linked to public health (Mayrhofer and Gupta 2016 ; Fleming et al., 2019 ). Links between the co-impacts framing and the SDGs are less well covered, although the importance of these links is beginning to be recognised, as is demonstrated through the selected examples in NDCs as presented in this paper. Having said this, the NDCs largely focus on co-benefits, rather than including potential adverse side effects. To support further work in this area, the paper presents a framework for mapping climate change mitigation actions and their co-impacts to the SDGs. In doing so, it moves towards an enhanced platform for those working on climate change mitigation to collaborate with those working on other areas of development linked to achieving the SDGs. It provides a tractable way to link mitigation actions in all sectors to co-benefits and adverse side-effects, and thereby to the delivery of the SDGs. Such a framework could be helpful to those seeking to prioritise mitigation and development actions in policies and regulations, as well as those seeking to allocate finance through channels such as the Global Environment Fund (GEF). The paper has shown that many climate change mitigation actions have potential co-impacts in a large number of sectors and development objectives. While their identification is a precondition for deriving optimum policy packages, in many cases a weighting of different trade-offs and synergies is required. Monetisation of co-impacts is often challenging, and other approaches such as weighing by distance-to-target (e.g. Castellani et al., 2016; Hebinck et al., 2021 ;) have been proposed. The SDG framework – and making explicit the links between climate change mitigation actions and the SDG indicators – provides a vehicle for the operationalization of co-impacts assessment. Other metrics frameworks are being developed, for example in the context of sustainable food systems in an attempt to include sustainability aspects of health and nutrition, climate and environment, and socio-economy/equity (Béné et al., 2019; Chaudhary et al., 2018; Eme et al., 2019; Fanzo et al., 2020; Hebinck et al., 2021 ). Indicators used to quantify the co-benefits of mitigation projects under emissions trading schemes such as the Accounting for Nature framework (Wentworth Group, 2016 ), and the Core Benefits Verification Framework (Aboriginal Carbon Foundation 2019 ) are further examples of locally-developed indicators that capture environmental, social and economic co-impacts of mitigation actions. Assessment of co-impacts is critical to ensuring support for any climate change mitigation action, but also to ensure maximum positive impacts for sustainable development. This requires tools and instruments to identify any possible direct and indirect synergistic or trade-off cross-sectoral effects, and to quantify and compare them with transparent, accepted and suitable indicator frameworks.
