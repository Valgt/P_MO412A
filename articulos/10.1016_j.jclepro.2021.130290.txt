                  The study investigates the extent, progress and level of improvement over time of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reporting by companies worldwide. It also examines whether SDG reporting differs due to country-level institutional factors. Using a sample of 6942 company-year observations in thirty (30) countries from 2016 to 2019, the study utilises 17 SDGs indicators developed by the United Nations (UN) as its SDGs reporting index. The findings indicate that, despite little company-level SDG reporting in 2016, the trend has gradually moved upward over the sample period. We also find that SDGs reporting differs for companies in countries with sustainability regulation and better SDGs performance ratings. Contrary to our expectations, higher SDG reporting was found for companies in shareholder-oriented countries than in stakeholder-oriented countries. Furthermore, we find that companies in developing countries did higher company-level SDGs reporting than those in developed countries. The findings of this study have important implications, given that SDG reporting attracts global attention in recent times.

Handling Editor: Dr. Govindan Kannan The study investigates the extent, progress and level of improvement over time of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reporting by companies worldwide. It also examines whether SDG reporting differs due to country-level institutional factors. Using a sample of 6942 company-year observations in thirty (30) countries from 2016 to 2019, the study utilises 17 SDGs indicators developed by the United Nations (UN) as its SDGs reporting index. The findings indicate that, despite little company-level SDG reporting in 2016, the trend has gradually moved upward over the sample period. We also find that SDGs reporting differs for companies in countries with sustainability regulation and better SDGs performance ratings. Contrary to our expectations, higher SDG reporting was found for companies in shareholder-oriented countries than in stakeholder-oriented countries. Furthermore, we find that companies in developing countries did higher company-level SDGs reporting than those in developed countries. The findings of this study have important implications, given that SDG reporting attracts global attention in recent times.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  SDGs reporting  Sustainability regulation  Stakeholder-orientation  International    1 Introduction Recent decades have witnessed an exponential growth and reporting of non-financial information encompassing many aspects, such as sustainability, the environment, climate change, green banking, human rights, etc. both in academic literature and in practice (Bose et al., 2021a , 2021b ; Emma and Jennifer, 2021 ; Pizzi et al., 2020 ; Simnett et al., 2009 ; Xie et al., 2021 ). The latest addition to this non-financial reporting is the emergence of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) developed and promoted by the United Nations (UN) (Bebbington and Unerman, 2018 ). Inaugurated in 2015 with a set of 17 interrelated goals and 244 indicators (Bebbington and Unerman, 2018 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019a ; United Nations (UN), 2021 ), the SDGs are aimed at establishing a better, more liveable planet by 2030 through achieving multiple social goals (e.g., no hunger, zero poverty, quality education, diversity, gender equality, reduced inequality, etc.) and environmental goals (e.g., combating CO2  emissions, providing clean water and clean energy uses, protecting biodiversity in oceans, etc.) (United Nations (UN), 2021; 2015 ). The SDGs require governments and private sectors involvement to work collectively to transform our world into a liveable planet (United Nations (UN), 2015 ). The current study aims to investigate the extent of SDGs reporting by companies worldwide. We also investigate whether company-level SDGs reporting has improved over time. Additionally, we explore the country-level institutional factors influencing SDGs reporting. Different practitioners' reports have evidenced that executives from companies worldwide have started to engage with SDG reporting. To illustrate, Price waterhouse Coopers (PwC) (2015) on their business awareness and intentions survey on SDGs showed that even six months before the SDGs were officially launched, 92% of the 986 responding businesses were aware of the SDGs – compared to 33% of the 2015 citizen respondents. A recent survey by KPMG (2020)  revealed that, in 2020, 70% or more of the top 100 companies had referenced the SDGs in their sustainability reporting from multiple regions, namely, Asia, North America, Europe and Latin America. But three years earlier, in 2017, the top countries for reporting on the SDGs were all in Europe or Latin America (KPMG, 2020 ). Overall, the KPMG (2020)  survey suggested that the UN's SDGs had resounded strongly with the business since their launch in 2015, with SDG initiatives have increased gradually between 2017 and 2020. Against this backdrop, scholars have emphasised the need for further research on SDGs initiatives and SDGs reporting. According to Bebbington and Unerman (2018) , SDGs are likely to open new avenues for sustainability research and remind accounting researchers of relatively neglected areas of this sustainable development. Furthermore, Bebbington et al. (2017)  argued that the SDGs and their potential have only just emerged in the sustainability literature, with further research endeavours are required in this context. The current study addresses this gap. Our attempt is timely since business awareness of, and commitment to, the SDGs are not only a new worldwide phenomenon in recent years, but because more companies now have a better understanding of the SDGs and the aptness of their inclusion in sustainability reporting should have more empirical investigation (PwC, 2015 ). Within the available sustainability literature, there are limited studies that explored different issues, such as providing interesting insights and recommendations outlining the role of accountants and the accounting profession in addressing the SDGs (Bebbington and Unerman, 2018 ); empirical evidence on the country-level institutional factors (e.g., politics and law, economics and finance, society and culture, technology and innovation, education and labour, and sustainability) (Rosati and Faria, 2019a ); and organisational factors (e.g., a firm's size, higher level of intangible assets, higher commitment to sustainability frameworks and external assurance, higher proportion of female directors and younger board of directors) influencing to SDG reporting (Rosati and Faria, 2019b ). However, previous studies have not explored the trends of SDGs reporting over time, which displays the ongoing commitment of firms SDGs reporting. Similarly, only a limited understanding exists in relation to the influence of country-level factors on SDGs reporting globally. Overall, the study has the following research questions:RQ-1 What is the extent of SDG reporting among companies worldwide over time?  RQ-2 Does company-level SDG reporting vary owing to country-level factors?    Based on a sample of 6941 company-year observations from 30 countries from 2016 to 2019, we utilise the 17-item SDG indicators developed by the UN as its SDG Reporting Index. We employ the mean tests to explore the research hypotheses. We find that, although company-level SDG reporting was very scanty in 2016, an upward trend emerges over the sample period (2016–2019). We also find that SDGs reporting is higher for countries with sustainability regulation and better SDGs performance. In addition, the level of SDGs reporting is higher for companies domiciled in shareholder-oriented countries than for those in stakeholder-oriented countries, with a similar result for developing countries over developed countries. Our study makes key contributions to the limited SDGs research in the sustainability literature. Firstly, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first study to examine the progress and improvement (if any) of SDGs reporting over time by firms operating worldwide. The current study's findings provide evidence of the initial preparedness of company-level reporting on SDGs issues by global firms, as well as companies' subsequent commitment and endeavour to make continuous progress in embracing the SDGs information. Secondly, by providing evidence that SDGs reporting differs due to many country-level factors, the current study adds a further glimpse into what and why country-level factors are important in understanding SDG reporting (for other academic contributions, see section 6 ). The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2  discusses business cases for SDGs and the literature review, while Section 3  develops the hypotheses. Section 4  reports the data and methodology, followed by the discussion of results in section 5 . The final section (Section 6 ) concludes the paper.  2 Business cases for SDGs adoption and literature review 2.1 Business cases for companies to adopt sustainable development goals (SDGs) The UN emphasised that achieving SDGs goals would require collective action and partnerships across governments and private sector organisations (Bebbington and Unerman, 2018 ; Di Vaio and Varriale, 2020 ; Peng et al., 2021 ). However, scholars argue that current business models of firms based on efficient resource consumption and production are essentially advancing numerous unsustainable business practices (Scheyvens et al., 2016 ; Sullivan et al., 2018 ). To illustrate, in addition to propelling ongoing social inequality, accelerating poor working conditions and unfair wages, violating human rights, creating persistent poverty and social injustice, the current consumption and production business models are basically responsible for waste production, greenhouse gas emissions, and the decline and deterioration of ecosystems and biodiversity (Pizzi et al., 2020 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019a ; Scheyvens et al., 2016 ; Whiteman et al., 2013 ; Xie et al., 2021 ). Nevertheless, in recent years, the growing consensus among business decision-makers towards achieving long term sustainability indicates that decision-makers of firms are able to address global sustainability challenges as well as can create value for different stakeholders through incorporating sustainability issues in their business model, strategy, operation and risk mitigation (Adams, 2017 ; Gao and Bansal, 2013 ; Scheyvens et al., 2016 ; Searcy and Buslovich, 2014 ). If companies’ decision-makers embrace the SDGs spirit, long-term sustainable benefits will result not only for their fund providers but also for all other stakeholders (UN, 2015 ). Indeed, by adopting SDGs, firms compound benefits in multiple ways. To illustrate, adopting more sustainable practices (e.g., utilising renewable energy, achieving ‘green building’ certification, reducing waste and CO2  emissions, reducing inequality, practising diversity in the workforce, etc.) not only saves companies financial resources in the long run but contributes to many SDGs (Whiteman et al., 2013 ). Their SDG practices may also have compounding social effects. For example, a company's tiny portion of donations from its revenue and standing beside various social causes displays its commitment, and demonstrates firms as ‘people and planet oriented’ leading to the contribution to community, the environment, hunger reduction, poverty alleviation, etc. (SDGs 1 and 2). These practices later enable them to enjoy competitive advantages in the industry. Similarly, a company's collaboration with its entire value chain for sustainability has a tangible impact not only on its own business and its value chain partners but also on the community and the natural environment (SDG 17), improving the sustainable use of natural resources below water and on land (SDGs 14 and 15). In addition, ensuring a safe working environment positively impacts on the health of an organisation's workforce (SDG 3) and also increase employees' productivity and retention rates, as well as enhance employee's satisfaction. Lastly, companies' costs of preparing SDGs reporting would be minimal as many companies worldwide have already established sustainability practices and reporting initiatives. Arguably, the sustainable development and SDGs endeavours not only reduce the operational costs of companies but enable many non-financial benefits, namely, building and regaining their reputation and image, achieving customer retentions and new customer acceptance, and obtaining ongoing support from the community and other stakeholders (e.g., social legitimacy).  2.2 Review of previous studies on SDGs reporting and the research gap Within available literature of SDGs, the key contribution was provided by Rosati and Faria (2019a) , who presented empirical evidence from data collected from 2413 firms in 90 different countries. Their study specifically covered country-level institutional factors (e.g., politics and law, economics and finance, society and culture, technology and innovation, education and labour, and sustainability) that affected SDG adoption within firms' non-financial reporting. In another study using data from 408 firms, Rosati and Faria (2019b)  provided evidence that organisational factors (e.g., a firm's size, higher level of intangible assets, higher commitment to sustainability frameworks and external assurance, higher proportion of female directors and younger board of directors) were related to SDGs reporting. The study by Ike et al. (2019) , in evaluating a sample of decision makers from Japanese companies, identified the main factors influencing the prioritisation of SDGs within non-financial reports. In addition, Pizzi et al. (2021) , in their recent study in Italy, reported a positive relationship between a firm's SDG reporting and factors, such as report type, as well as other governance factors, namely, the presence of independent directors on the board, the firm's expertise with non-financial reporting, etc. The above-mentioned previous studies have enhanced our understanding of SDG practices and company-level SDGs reporting in different contexts. However, the current study differs from these previous studies in many ways. For example, although the study by Rosati and Faria (2019a)  considered some country-level factors, it is also important to consider other country-level factors, such as sustainability regulation, SDGs performance score, nature of corporate governance models, which are likely to affect company-level SDGs reporting. Likewise, in terms of methodology, previous studies looked into the absence or presence of the “term SDGs” in companies sustainability reports using only one category (0 for no reporting of SDGs and 1 for reporting), with data collected from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) database rather than using SDGs indicators by UN (Rosati and Faria, 2019a ). The biggest challenge with this “SDGs term” type of investigation is that it lacks a comprehensive understanding of the extent of SDGs reporting in its depth and breadth (i.e., whether companies captured all 17 SDGs in their reporting or not will be untracked). Additionally, with this "SDGs term" research, it is undoubtedly difficult to understand how many of the 17 SDGs are reported by a particular company. The current study addresses this limitation by considering the SDGs reporting score taking the UN's SDG reporting items as SDGs index with a range between 0 and 17 (for the detailed discussion, see ‘Research design’). Lastly, our study aims to understand companies' SDGs reporting and its variations across the world and over time, an attempt entirely absent in the past studies. Accordingly, the first research question (RQ) of this study is:RQ-1 What is the extent of SDGs reporting among companies worldwide over time?      3 Hypotheses development 3.1 Country-level factors influencing SDGs reporting (RQ-2) 3.1.1 Sustainability regulation and SDGs reporting From the perspective of institutional theory, sustainability regulation would be treated as a regulative force in an institutional environment where firms are required to follow the demand and expectations of powerful stakeholders such as regulators (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983 ; Khan et al., 2020 ). Firms do meet the expectations of this powerful stakeholder as firms will have legitimacy problems if regulatory expectations are not fulfilled. Furthermore, national regulators or industry-specific regulators play a key role in monitoring sustainability regulations (Khan et al., 2020 , 2021a ). Consequently, it is understandable that when national regulators impose sustainability regulations, or mandate rules for sustainable development, companies generally tend to comply with these regulations as they are being dependent on national regulators for their business growth. Regulatory rules and expectations push firms to display their responsibilities to a wider stakeholder community in their industry (Kinderman, 2020 ) which, in turn, yields benefits for the companies themselves (Khan et al., 2020 , 2021a ). However, to date, no empirical evidence has provided testimony of the association between sustainability regulation and the level of SDGs reporting. Accordingly, we argue that national-level sustainability regulation will have a key influence on the use of SDGs reporting by firms. The reason is that when sustainability regulation is already in place in countries, national regulators in those countries will already have monitoring and controlling mechanisms which can be used for tracking companies’ initiatives in SDGs adoption, and SDGs reporting improvement. Therefore, we formulate the following hypothesis:H1 The level of SDGs reporting is higher for companies in countries with more stringent sustainability regulation than for companies in countries with less stringent sustainability regulation.     3.1.2 Country-level SDGs performance and SDGs reporting The current study argues that national-level SDGs performance assessed by the United Nations (UN) influences company-level SDGs reporting. The underlying reasons of our argument are when assessing the national-level SDGs performance score, the UN considers many other issues, namely budgeting and finance flows (requiring both public and private investment); expenditure reviews; public–private partnerships (PPPs) and the national-level SDGs monitoring mechanism (United Nations (UN), 2017 ). Additionally, the availability of multi-layer stakeholders' engagement and feedback in various forms are also considered in assessing the SDGs performance score.1  1 These include citizen panels, focus groups, online consultations/surveys, expert panels or meeting(s) with key stakeholder groups as well as the role of key stakeholders such as business associations, consumers' associations, trade unions, think tanks, etc. (UN, 2017 ).   Lastly, for a given country, to secure the better SDGs performance score, a coordinated effort from all private and public sector organisations is evaluated (Sachs et al., 2019 ; United Nations (UN), 2017 ). Indeed, a collective actions and initiatives by the states, citizens, organisations, socially responsible investors, institutional investors, and industries are required to implement SDGs and perform better in SDGs performance (Sachs et al., 2019 ). Accordingly, we argue that firms in those countries with better SDGs performance scores will accommodate all stakeholders’ expectations and better concentrate on adopting sustainable development programs. Otherwise, a country would not be able to secure higher SDGs performance scores. Overall, when country-level SDG performance remains high, it is undeniable that company-level SDGs initiatives and endeavours in that country would be more substantial and comprehensive than in those countries with a low SDGs performance score. Formally stated:H2 The level of SDGs reporting by companies will be higher in countries with a higher level of SDGs performance than for companies in countries with a lower level of SDGs performance.     3.1.3 Stakeholder-oriented countries versus shareholder-oriented countries and SDGs reporting Scholars have suggested that a stakeholder-oriented business culture, commonly available in the code law countries (e.g., France, Sweden, Norway, Germany and others), prioritises a broad spectrum of stakeholders' demands and interests with that country's society having a legitimate interest in corporate activities (Holder-Webb et al., 2009 ; Simnett et al., 2009 ; Smith et al., 2005 ). Stakeholder groups in these countries are likely to have considerable influence upon companies' activities, including the adoption of stakeholder-oriented corporate governance model and non-financial reporting. In contrast, in a shareholder-oriented business culture practised in the common law countries (e.g., USA, UK, or Australia), companies are primarily seen as catalysts for the creation and maximisation of shareholders value; therefore, other stakeholder groups have less influence on corporate activities (Simnett et al., 2009 ). By practising stakeholder-oriented corporate governance model within countries, firms uphold the interest of multiple stakeholders rather than concentrating solely on protecting powerful shareholders' interests (Jensen and Berg, 2012 ; Smith et al., 2005 ). Policy, procedures and governance taken by decision-makers in stakeholders-oriented countries reflect the interests of the stakeholders in the societies (Jensen and Berg, 2012 ). Empirically, the work of Holder-Webb et al. (2009)  evidenced that US companies lagged behind international companies regarding social responsibility reporting as the cultural environment in which they operated had a greater shareholder orientation. Simnett et al. (2009) , in their research on 31 countries, reported that companies domiciled in stakeholder-oriented countries chose the auditing profession to verify their sustainability reporting more than was the case in countries with a shareholder-orientation. However, in case of SDGs reporting, no previous studies have provided empirical evidence in this regard. From the above discussion, we expect that, in a country with a greater stakeholder's orientation, the SDGs reporting would be more intense than in countries with a shareholder orientation. The reason is that countries with a stakeholder orientation will address different sustainability issues, namely, human rights, ecology, diversity, climate change, etc. On the other hand, in countries with a greater shareholder orientation, companies will have less intensity and a lower willingness to adopt SDGs reporting. Formally stated:H3 The level of SDGs reporting by companies will be higher for companies domiciled in stakeholder-oriented countries than for companies domiciled in shareholder-oriented countries.     3.1.4 Developed versus developing countries (in terms of economic growth and development) and SDGs reporting The growth and development of SDGs reporting can also be related to the economic development of a company's home country. It has been argued that developed countries with higher levels of economic prosperity have more pronounced institutional capacity for embracing non-financial reporting issues, such as CSR or the sustainable development agenda (Busco et al., 2019 ; Husted, 2005 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019a ). Companies in these countries naturally have more resources to dedicate to sustainability and/or the sustainable development goals agenda (Baughn et al., 2007 ; Busco et al., 2019 ). Busco et al. (2019)  provided empirical evidence that a country's economic development affects the company-level capacity to include non-financial reporting, for instance, through integrated reporting. Indeed, companies in a country with better economic development may display higher priority to embracing the SDGs, not only due to their available financial capability but also as they may believe that, by embracing the SDGs, they can demonstrate their ongoing leadership to the global community. Conversely, the SDGs may not be feasible for countries with poor economic growth and prosperity, specifically for the developing countries, as governments in these countries may have other priorities and commitments for their citizens. Companies in the developing countries might prioritise working with their governments, with their emphasis on SDGs may be subject to country-level economic conditions, therefore, will be less motivated for SDGs reporting unless SDGs efforts are imposed by the donor agencies as the precondition of foreign aid & loans. Overall, we argue that companies in developed countries are predicted to have more SDGs reporting than companies in developing countries. Formally stated:H4 The level of SDGs reporting for companies will be higher in developed countries than for companies in developing countries.       4 Research design 4.1 Sample and data The sample of this study consists of all companies covered by the Refinitiv (previously Thomson Reuters) ESG database from 2016 to 2019. Our sample periods start from 2016, as the UN declared the SDGs during 2015, with 2019 being the final year of data collection. Initially, we obtained 9586 company-year observations of SDGs data from the Refinitiv ESG database. However, 2645 company-year observations were excluded due to the non-availability of country-level data. Table 1  , Panel A shows the sample selection process. The final sample consists of 6941 company-year observations across 30 countries covering the period from 2016 to 2019. Country-level data are collected from the World Bank database and country-level SDGs performance scores is collected from the United Nations (UN). Table 1 , Panel B shows the industry-wide distribution of companies in this study's sample. It shows that the sample is dominated by companies operating in the financial industry (10.49%), followed by the services industry (9.31%) and the computer industry (8.64%), while miscellaneous manufacturing industries have the lowest distribution (0.63%). Furthermore, in the sample, 2019 accounts for the highest proportion of observations (39.50%), followed by 2018 (36.77%), while 2016 has the lowest proportion (2.61%), indicating that companies across the world gradually increased their rate of SDGs reporting.  4.2 Measure of sustainable development goals (SDGs) In the current study, an index of SDGs reporting was developed, comprising the 17 items set by the United Nations (UN). Table 2  , Panel B provides the list of items included in the SDGs Reporting Index. To derive measurements for the company-level SDGs Reporting Index, we relied on the Refinitiv ESG database that collects these datapoints from annual reports and sustainability reports. The content analysis technique was employed to quantify the SDGs data available on the database in line with prior studies (Bose et al., 2021a ; Khan et al., 2021b ). In this study, an unweighted approach is utilised in which each item of the SDGs in the index is deemed to be equally important (Bose et al., 2017 , 2021a ). A score of 1 is assigned if the Refinitiv ESG database is coded “Yes”, with a score of 0 assigned if it is coded “No”. Based on this scoring technique, the overall SDGs Reporting Index (SDGs)  is developed. The overall SDG Reporting Index (SDG ) score captures the ratio of aggregate reporting score to the maximum possible reporting score (i.e., 17) for each company-year. A higher SDGs  score indicates a higher level of SDGs reporting. The study uses Cronbach's alpha coefficient values to assess the SDG Reporting Index (SDG )'s internal consistency, following prior studies (Khan et al., 2021a ; Rashid et al., 2020 ), with the value of 0.962 indicating that the items in SDG reporting capture the same underlying constructs.  4.3 Measurement of other key variables For testing RQ-2 (H1–H4), we measure country-level factors, namely sustainability regulation stringency (SUST_REG) ; SDGs performance (CSDG) ; stakeholder orientation vs. shareholder orientation (STAKEHOLDER vs. SHAREHOLDER) ; and the economic status of a country (DEVELOPED vs. DEVELOPING)  using scales from previous studies. For sustainability regulation stringency (Maso et al., 2019 ), an indicator variable (HIGH_SUST_REG)  is created that takes a value of 1 if country-level sustainability regulation stringency is above the median, and 0 otherwise (LOW_ SUST_ REG) . Furthermore, for country-level SDGs performance, an indicator variable (HIGH_CSDG)  is created that takes a value of 1 if the country-level SDGs performance score is above the median, and 0 otherwise (LOW_ CSDG) . Moreover, following Simnett et al. (2009) , we measure country-level stakeholder orientation as an indicator variable with a value of 1 if the company is domiciled in code law countries (STAKEHOLDER) , and a value of 0 if the company is domiciled in common law countries (SHAREHOLDER).  For classifying countries into developed and developing categories, we follow the country classification developed by the United Nations (UN) (2020) . The definitions of variables and measurements used are provided in the Appendix .   5 Discussion of empirical results 5.1 Status of SDGs reporting and progress over the year (RQ-1) Table 2 , Panel B presents the extent of SDGs reporting based on the individual components of SDGs over the study's sample periods (2016–2019). Table 2  shows that the overall SDGs reporting by sample companies is very low over the sample period. Specifically, as shown in Panel A of Table 2 , in aggregate, we find only 585 firm-year observations (8.40%) have some SDGs reporting, while 6356 firm-year observations (91.60%) did not disclose any single goals over the sample period. Furthermore, Panel B of Table 2  shows the year-wise distribution of SDGs reporting. In 2019, on average, 9.70% [or (0.097 × 17) = 1.649 items] of SDGs items were disclosed by the sample companies, while the reporting level in previous years was even worse. For example, in 2018 (0.009), specifically, less than 1% of SDGs items were disclosed by the sample companies. In 2016 these figures are not praiseworthy at all (0.20%), and 2017 (0.10%) respectively, but probably not surprising, because the year 2016, and 2017 are the initial two years after the declaration of SDGs by the United Nations. Within SDGs indicators, information on “SDG8: Decent work and economic growth” is disclosed by the highest number of companies (7%), ranging from 0.60% to 16.50% over the study's sample periods. Moreover, about 5.50% of companies in the sample disclose information on “SDG5: Gender equality” ranging from 0.60% to 11.70% from 2016 to 2019, followed by “SDG3: Good health and well-being” (5.50%) ranging from 0.00% to 12.60%. The item “SDG2: Zero hunger” had the least amount of disclosed information, with the probable reason being that “Zero hunger” is a government goal rather than that of a company. Table 3   presents the country-wide distribution of average SDGs reporting by companies in the study's sample. The information is presented by country and region. Among the regions, it shows that the average SDGs score of European companies over the sample period is 0.074, suggesting that, on average, European companies disclose 1.26 (17 items × 0.074) SDG items. Further, the average SDG score of Latin America and the Caribbean companies is 0.062, suggesting that, on average, companies from this continent disclose 1.05 (17 items × 0.062) SDGs items. But the companies in the Oceania region disclose the least number of SDGs items. As shown in Table 3 , among companies in the study's sample, those in the Philippines are the top performers in terms of SDGs reporting, while those in Greece have the lowest level of SDGs reporting. Among the European countries, companies in Italy provide the highest level of SDGs reporting (14.10%, i.e., 2.40 SDGs items), followed by those in Spain (12.60%, i.e., 2.14 SDG items), while those in Greece do not provide any SDG reporting (0.00%). Among the Asian countries, companies in the Philippines provide the highest level of SDGs reporting (15.70%, i.e., 2.67 SDG items), followed by those in Singapore (11.20%, i.e., 1.90 SDGs items), while companies in South Korea have the lowest (1.80%, i.e., 0.306 SDGs items). Among countries in Latin America and the Caribbean region, companies in Mexico provide the highest SDGs reporting (10.70%, i.e., 1.819 SDG items), while companies in Australia (2.50%, i.e., 0.425 SDG items) have the highest level of reporting among countries in Oceania, and likewise with companies in Canada (2.90%, i.e., 0.493 SDG items) for the North America region and companies in South Africa (5.70%, i.e., 0.969 SDG items) for the African region as shown in Table 3 . Fig. 1   shows the continent and year-wise graphical presentation of SDG scores in each year. Furthermore, the country and year-wise graphical presentation of SDGs scores within each continent is presented from Figs. 2–7       . As can be seen in Fig. 2 , in 2019, Portugal has the highest score among the European countries (mean = 0.451), followed by Spain (mean = 0.428) and Italy (mean = 0.371). These countries SDGs reporting scores have been increased from previous years. Among the Asian countries (Fig. 3 ), India (mean = 0.765) reports the highest level of SDG reporting in 2019, and such reporting shows an increasing trend for this country compared to previous years (mean = 0.035 in 2018 and mean = 0.000 both years in 2016 and 2017). Among Latin America and the Caribbean, Mexico (mean = 0.434) has secured the highest level of SDGs reporting in 2019 (Fig. 4 ). Among Oceania continent, Australian firms provide more SDG reporting compared to New Zealand firms in the Oceania continent (Fig. 5 ). Among North America, Canadian firms provide a higher level of SDGs reporting compared to United State (US) (Fig. 6 ). Furthermore, Fig. 7  shows the year-wise graphical presentation of SDG scores for African continent. We have only one African country in our sample, South Africa. South African firms provide SDG reporting only in 2018 and 2019. Table 4   provides the country-level descriptive statistics. Our sample is dominated by firms operating in the United States (U.S.) (37.93%), followed by those in the United Kingdom (U.K.) (7.64%) and Japan (6.92%), while Portugal (0.26%) has the lowest number of firms. Regarding SDGs reporting, within our sample, the mean value of SDGs in each country has been increased over the years, indicating that SDGs reporting has been improved over time by our sample firms in different countries. Regarding year-wise SDG reporting, Indian firms (mean = 76.47%) disclosed the highest level of SDG reporting in 2019, followed by Philippine firms (54.90%), while Greek firms did not disclose any information over our sample period. About 66.61% of our sample countries are stakeholder-oriented. Furthermore, about 66.61% of our sample countries have developing country status according to United Nations (UN) (2020) . Furthermore, Sweden (mean = 85.08) has the highest country-level SDGs performance ratings, followed by Denmark (mean = 84.75) and Finland (83.16), while India (mean = 59.98) has the lowest.  5.2 Hypotheses results: country-level factors and SDGs reporting (RQ-2) To test the study's RQ-2 (H1–H4), that is, whether SDGs reporting (SDG_DISC)  differs in companies in this study's sample owing to country-level factors, the study employs t -test statistics. Table 5  , Panel A reports the results of H1. It shows that the mean of SDG_DISC  for countries with higher sustainability regulation stringency (HIGH_SUST_REG)  is 0.063, which is higher than for countries with lower sustainability regulation stringency (HIGH_SUST_REG)  at 0.020, with the mean test indicating statistical significance (p  < 0.01). Therefore, H1 is supported. Based on these findings, we argue that the level of SDGs reporting is more intensified in countries where national regulators have already taken initiatives and established regulation for sustainable development than in those countries that currently have no sustainability regulation stringency. Table 5 , Panel B presents the results for H2 . Consistent with our predictions, the mean of SDG_DISC  for higher SDGs performance countries (HIGH_CSDG)  is 0.056, which is higher than for lower SDGs performance countries (LOW_CSDG)  at 0.033, with the mean test indicating statistical significance (p  < 0.01). Therefore, H2  is supported. This finding indicates that SDGs reporting is more evident in those countries with better national-level SDGs performance than in those countries that currently have lower SDGs performance. Table 5 , Panel C presents the results for H3 . They show that the mean of SDG_DISC  for stakeholder-oriented countries (STAKEHOLDER)  is 0.029, which is lower than for shareholder-oriented countries (SHAREHOLDER)  at 0.067, with the mean test indicating statistical significance (p  < 0.01). Inconsistent with our expectation, no evidence is found that SDG reporting is higher in companies from stakeholder-oriented countries than in companies from shareholder-oriented countries. This finding, whilst surprising, is not unrealistic given that in many shareholder-oriented countries (e.g., Australia), institutional shareholders currently emphasise their requirement for different types of sustainability information on areas such as CO2  emissions and climate change and on many social causes and other components of sustainability.2  2 In Australia, in 2017, a renowned bank (the Commonwealth Bank of Australia) was the subject of a lawsuit from ‘Mum and Dad’ investors for failing to take adequate measures for climate change, and for not disclosing information on climate change-related risks and initiatives. (for details see https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/21/commonwealth-bank-shareholders-drop-suit-over-non-disclosure-of-climate-risks  (accessed on 15 November 2021).   Table 5 , Panel D presents the results for H4. The mean of SDG_DISC  for developed countries (DEVELOPED)  is 0.038, which is lower than for developing countries (DEVELOPING)  at 0.067, and the mean test indicates statistical significance (p  < 0.01). Again, no evidence is found that companies in developed countries have a higher level of SDG reporting than those in developing countries. This finding is not surprising. Many recent reports published by practitioners (e.g., Ernst & Young [E&Y]3  3 https://www.ey.com/en_au/sustainable-development-goals  (accessed on 10 November 2021).   and KPMG4  4 https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/about/our-role-in-the-world/citizenship/sdgindustrymatrix.html  (accessed on 10 November 2021).  ) indicate that the initiative, commitment, and actual implementation of sustainable development in developing countries, such as China, Indonesia, Brazil and South Africa, among others, have exponentially increased in recent years compared to the pace of change in developed countries.   6 Conclusion This study explores the extent, improvement, and variation of SDGs reporting by companies worldwide from 2016 to 2019. It also examines whether SDGs reporting differs due to country-level factors using the cross-country context. We find that the overall SDGs reporting by sample companies was quite low during the sample period. We also find that SDGs reporting differs for companies in countries with national sustainability regulation and better SDGs performance scores evaluated by the UN. However, contrary to our expectation, SDGs reporting is found to be higher for companies in shareholder-oriented countries than for those in stakeholder-oriented countries. Interestingly, we find that SDGs reporting is more pronounced for companies in developing countries than for those in developed countries. The findings of the study have several implications for academic literature. Firstly, it contributes to the development and advancement of the new research area, specifically reporting of SDGs information. By providing empirical evidence of SDGs reporting of firms across the world in this regard, the current study advances our understanding and fill in the research gap. Secondly, our study opens up a novel area of empirical research through introducing trends of and/or ongoing commitment of companies worldwide relating to SDGs reporting. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first study that looked into worldwide firms’ SDGs reporting efforts in multiple years, therefore contributing to the literature. Lastly, by providing empirical evidence relating to four country-level factors influencing SDGs reporting, the current study has opened up an increased understanding that different national attributes/features create real differences for the SDGs improvements and endeavour relating to SDGs reporting. The study's findings also have practical value for various stakeholders. Specifically, given the importance of the sustainability theme, it seems that stakeholder-based corporate governance models are not relevant here as shareholder-oriented countries are embracing SDG reporting more than stakeholder-oriented countries. Therefore, regulators of stakeholders-based countries should initiate more involvement of SDGs related initiatives and continue their effort. Given that SDG reporting score is very low in almost all companies worldwide during 2016–2018, it is likely that firms in different jurisdictions are still at the misperception phase on whether and why they need to embrace SDGs reporting when they have a well-established mechanism of providing information on CSR, sustainability and carbon reporting. Accordingly, responsibilities are ultimately rested on the national regulators who can promote SDGs and imparting the importance of SDGs for different industries and how firms in each context can capitalise benefits of adopting SDGs. Likewise, our findings have a key message for the United Nations (UN). The UN, in association with its development partners in different countries (governments and other bodies), should organise regular workshops, seminars and training with company managers, business associations and leaders to create awareness and to build capability for companies adopting and embracing SDGs worldwide so as to enable the UN's aspirations to materialise by 2030. Nevertheless, our study is subject to some limitations. Firstly, we have focused on the level of SDGs reporting and four country-level determinants of such reporting. Future research should examine other firm level factors that may drive SDGs reporting and investigate the impact of SDGs reporting on firms' market performance. Furthermore, for an in-depth understanding of the SDGs topic, future studies should examine various stakeholders' opinions, understanding various driving forces and challenges experienced by managers for SDGs implementation and SDGs reporting using qualitative research design (e.g., interviews, case studies) in different cross-countries settings. Lastly, decision-makers commitment in different jurisdictions during the post-COVID-19 world is a solid candidate for future research as the current study has only addressed pre-COVID-19 firms’ commitment to SDGs reporting due to the non-availability of data.
