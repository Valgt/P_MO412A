                  Pollution from untreated wastewater discharges depletes clean water supply for humans and the environment. It poses adverse economic impacts by determining agricultural yields, manufacturing productivity, and ecosystem functionality. Current studies mainly focus on quantity-related water scarcity assessment. It is unknown how low water quality amplifies local water stress and induces cascading economic risks globally. In this study, we estimated both quality and quantity-related water scarcity index (WSI), local economic water scarcity risk (WSR), and cascading virtual WSR evident in global trade markets across 40 major economies from 1995 to 2010. We find developing countries, e.g., India and China, witnessed fast growth in both quantity and quality-related WSI. Major developed economies, e.g., the US and Germany, experienced a modest increase in water stress but alleviated quality-related risks. Local economic risk (WSR) grew from $116B to $380B, with quality-related risks rising from 20 % to 30 %. Virtual economic WSR in global supply chains increased from $39B to $160B, with quality-related risks increasing from 19 % to 27 %. China became the top exporter of economic WSR, ranked above the US, France, and Japan, and the second-largest position as an importer, trailing only the US. We finally conducted scenario modeling by 2030, assuming different progresses on SDG 6 targets. The findings suggest that only the most ambitious progress in both water quality enhancement and efficiency improvement helps to alleviate ∼20 % economic WSR globally. Our findings underscore the necessity for strategies that integrate management of untreated wastewater flows, improved water use efficiency, and diversification of supply chain networks to enhance global economic resilience to water challenges in the future.

Pollution from untreated wastewater discharges depletes clean water supply for humans and the environment. It poses adverse economic impacts by determining agricultural yields, manufacturing productivity, and ecosystem functionality. Current studies mainly focus on quantity-related water scarcity assessment. It is unknown how low water quality amplifies local water stress and induces cascading economic risks globally. In this study, we estimated both quality and quantity-related water scarcity index (WSI), local economic water scarcity risk (WSR), and cascading virtual WSR evident in global trade markets across 40 major economies from 1995 to 2010. We find developing countries, e.g., India and China, witnessed fast growth in both quantity and quality-related WSI. Major developed economies, e.g., the US and Germany, experienced a modest increase in water stress but alleviated quality-related risks. Local economic risk (WSR) grew from $116B to $380B, with quality-related risks rising from 20 % to 30 %. Virtual economic WSR in global supply chains increased from $39B to $160B, with quality-related risks increasing from 19 % to 27 %. China became the top exporter of economic WSR, ranked above the US, France, and Japan, and the second-largest position as an importer, trailing only the US. We finally conducted scenario modeling by 2030, assuming different progresses on SDG 6 targets. The findings suggest that only the most ambitious progress in both water quality enhancement and efficiency improvement helps to alleviate ∼20 % economic WSR globally. Our findings underscore the necessity for strategies that integrate management of untreated wastewater flows, improved water use efficiency, and diversification of supply chain networks to enhance global economic resilience to water challenges in the future.

When there are insufficient water available, economic activities may be hampered or even halted, leading to a decrease in overall output or productivity. Inadequate water quality also has profound consequences on a variety of economic sectors (Russ et al., 2022 ). Low water quality negatively impacts agricultural productivity by introducing pollutants into the irrigation system and hindering plant growth and nutrient absorption (D'Odorico et al., 2018 ). Water pollution can also pose health risks, resulting in higher healthcare expenditures and productivity losses within the workforce (Danaei et al., 2016 ). Contaminants such as sediments and organic matter adversely affect power generation by reducing the efficiency of heat transfer and cooling systems, and may potentially increase maintenance costs by diminishing the operational lifespan of turbine blades (Ang et al., 2022 ). In essence, pollution will intensify water scarcity problems associated with inadequate water supply, underscoring the critical need to tackle both quantity and quality issues simultaneously. The process of rapid urbanization, coupled with growth in untreated wastewater which is typically discharged into lakes and river, or directly released into the ground, significantly deteriorates quality of both surface water and groundwater (UNEP, 2016 ). Consequently, this intensifies a country's water scarcity and regional inequality, particularly in developing countries (Ma et al., 2020 ; van Vliet et al., 2017 ). Eastern China, India, and parts of Central Asia are the world's most severe water scarcity hotspots, where water scarcity is largely driven by pollution (Van Vliet et al., 2021 ). These challenges run counter to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 6, with the overarching objective of achieving sustainable management of clean and accessible water for all. The goal itself aims to address challenges related to water scarcity, water quality, and sanitation. SDG 6.3 is one of the targets within SDG 6, aimed to improve water quality by halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials. Furthermore, SDG Indicator 6.3.2 is a specific metric under SDG 6, which focuses on assessing the water quality in various water bodies and helps track progress toward achieving SDG 6. It measures the proportion of bodies of water that meet the criteria for good water quality. Here, the definition of "good" is that water quality does not damage ecosystem and human health. Overall water quality is estimated based on core constituents of dissolved oxygen, salinity, nutrients, and acidity (Desbureaux et al., 2022 ; Weerasekara, 2017 ). Although there are high ambitions in the SDGs to mitigate water scarcity risks, in most cases, the quality aspect of water scarcity has not been fully incorporated into the framework of assessment. The constraints of water pollution on sectoral water use and hidden economic risks are currently underestimated by academics and decision-makers, hampering the progress toward the SDG 6 (Sadoff et al., 2020 ; Tzanakakis et al., 2020 ). Here, we briefly reviewed the latest progresses in related fields and main research gaps to be filled. 1.1 Quality-related physical water scarcity assessment Main approaches for water scarcity assessment utilized in prior studies, such as the Falkenmark  index, the water poverty index, and the criticality ratio (Liu et al., 2017 ), are easy to apply but focus on water quantity only and neglect water quality. In the past decade, there have been a growing number of studies seeking to develop combined evaluation methods to measure quantity and quality related water scarcity together. According to the underlying principles, these studies can be categorized into two distinct groups. The first category of studies is based on the gray water footprint approach. Gray water footprint is an indicator defined as the volume of freshwater required to dilute the pollutants generated by human activities (Hoekstra, 2011 ). Accordingly, pollution induced water scarcity can be measured as the ratio of gray water footprint to freshwater resources in a specific region. This approach was adopted by Zeng et al. (2013)  in an early study, who developed a blue and gray index to measure quantity and quality-related water scarcity together. They employed this water scarcity meter to examine the historical trend of water scarcity in Beijing, China, revealing a significantly higher gray water scarcity index of 2.3 compared to a blue water scarcity index of 1.2. Liu et al. (2016)  further improved this metric, by incorporating ecological environment flow (EFR) into the index. Their findings indicate that in order to maintain the health of the river ecosystem, additional allocation of blue water resources is required to meet the EFR, thereby intensifying water scarcity related to quality. Yet, utilizing the gray water footprint is limited by the lack of detailed insights into specific pollutants and variations in water quality standards, which always induce overestimation of pollution-induced water scarcity (Ansorge et al., 2022 ). In the second category of studies, quality-related water scarcity is estimated by using the ratio of the sectoral water withdrawals of acceptable quality to the water availability. In situations where a water quality constituent falls short of sector-specific quality requirements, additional water is required to achieve acceptable water quality through dilution. van Vliet et al. (2017)  refined this approach and assessed the constraints of water temperature, salinity, and nutrient levels on water usability and sectoral water scarcity at a global scale. They found that incorporating solely water temperature into evaluations of water scarcity results in an elevation of the global population experiencing severe water scarcity from more than 35 %. Following this method, Ma et al. (2020)  quantified the quality-based water scarcity risk across river basins in China. Their findings revealed notable seasonality in sectoral water scarcity proportions, with the agricultural water withdrawal and pollution making the most substantial contributions during the spring and summer months. The strength of this approach lies in its capacity for a nuanced assessment of pollution-induced water scarcity, considering both sectoral and pollutant-specific dimensions. However, due to the high costs in data collection and wrangling, large gaps exist in publicly available water quality monitoring records, especially for developing countries (Kirschke et al., 2020 ; UNEP, 2016 ). This limits our understandings of both quantity and quality-related water scarcity evolution and its economic risks.  1.2 Economic impacts caused by water scarcity and water pollution Despite great efforts in measuring physical water scarcity, to what extent water scarcity and water pollution matter for economic activity remains largely unknown. The literature highlighting a direct economic growth of water scarcity is mainly based on empirical strategies (Dell et al., 2014 ). Those studies rarely use water scarcity index as predictors, but focus on abnormal events such as drought, rainfall shock, and water service outages (Fishman, 2016 ; Russ, 2020 ). The indicators of economic performance are also diverse, which may include GDP, income, and productivity (Russ et al., 2022 ). For instance, drawing from panel data of agricultural firms in China, Lin and Sheng (2023)  present compelling evidence that drought has a substantial negative impact on the total factor productivity of these firms. Desbureaux and Rodella (2019)  used a panel data to quantify the effects of droughts on labor markets in major urban areas across Latin America. The study revealed that droughts led to a decline in employment by ∼1 %, a reduction in the number of hours worked by ∼4.5 %, and a decrease in labor incomes by ∼6.5 %. Deterioration of water quality may also decrease available clean water supply for industrial and residential water users and lead to potential economic output risks. However, to assess the economic impacts of water pollution can be more intricate, because pollution stems from economic activity and then in turn constrains economic activities (Ali and Puppim de Oliveira, 2018 ). It is challenging to isolate negative effects of pollution alone and fully determine the total value of clean water by simple statistical regression techniques (Keiser et al., 2019 ). The majority of prior research appraising the significance of clean water predominantly focus on the health advantages, such as estimating the prevention of premature deaths associated with elevated water quality (Knobeloch et al., 2000 ; Smith et al., 2011 ). Only recently, Russ et al. (2022)  adopted a quasi-experimental approach, leveraging the unidirectional flow of rivers to alleviate confounding or omitted variable bias, to examine the relationship between upstream water quality and downstream economic growth. The findings indicate that as river pollution reaches a critical level, GDP growth in downstream areas experiences a decline, ranging from 1.4 % to 2.5 %. Other than this study, to our knowledge, no additional research endeavors have undertaken to assess the hidden sectoral economic risks of water pollution. Generally, these econometric methods excel in explaining the complex channels through which water affects economic growth (Coury et al., 2022 ; Keeler et al., 2016 ; Keiser and Shapiro, 2019 ). However, they were mostly performed at a regional scale or focus on a certain industrial sector. Therefore, the findings pose challenges in terms of comparability across sectors, regions, and countries (Akhmouch et al., 2018 ). We also notice that very few studies have combined quantity and quality-based water scarcity to assess the comprehensive economic impact. It is unknown how pollution exacerbates sectoral output risks due to water scarcity on a global scale. Therefore, a more concise framework that assesses sectoral economic risks caused by both quantity and quality related water scarcity would provide valuable insights toward attaining SDGs associated with clean water, human well-being, and economic development.  1.3 Transfer of water scarcity risks along supply chains In a highly-connected world, the drivers of local water scarcity could be global and its impacts could be transmitted to downstream sectors through supply chains. Some studies have quantified the transfer of water footprint due to trade linkages, known as virtual water, and its impacts on water scarcity in distant locations (Hoekstra et al., 2012 ; Zhao et al., 2015 ). The most frequently applied method is based on the Input-output (IO) model linked with satellite accounts of water use and pollutant discharges (Garcia et al., 2020 ; Wiedmann, 2009 ). Their findings suggest that interregional trade of water-intensive products will reshape the pattern of water scarcity, saving water globally but exacerbating the risks in water-exporting countries (Feng et al., 2014 ; Qu et al., 2018 ). Moreover, the trading networks also drive more discharges of pollutants generated by human activities, worsen the water quality and lead to reduced available clean water. For instance, Wan et al. (2016)  examined the driving factors behind the transfer of nitrogen-related water pollution in the context of globalization. Their findings revealed that shifts in the global economy and consumption patterns tended to exacerbate gray water pollution in numerous countries, with China and India experiencing particularly heightened levels of gray water scarcity. In addition, Li et al. (2019)  further observed that the substantial reduction in China's exported COD emissions is partly due to the relocation of low-end and highly polluting industries to other developing nations. Understanding how water scarcity is transferred and embodied in traded goods allows policymakers to promote responsible consumption and production patterns. The aforementioned studies investigate embedded water transfer mainly from the perspective of consumption, delving into the environmental impacts arising from downstream demand drivers (Li et al., 2022 ). However, from a producer-centric standpoint, water scarcity-induced output reductions in upstream sectors can also propagate through the supply chain and lead to cascading economic losses in downstream sectors. In this regard, scholars have applied supply-side IO models to track the direct and indirect economic impacts of local water scarcity. Eamen et al. (2020)  developed an inter-regional and supply-side IO modeling framework to simulate the impacts of water supply restrictions due to climate and policy change. They applied the model in 6 sub-basins across 3 Canadian provinces, and found total economic losses caused by drought can be reduced by almost 50 % by adopting appropriate management practices. Qu et al. (2018)  also used supply-side IO to map the impacts of local water scarcity risk on global economy. They identified top nation-sectors in virtual water scarcity risk exports and imports. These studies recognized water scarcity risk (WSR) as a critical supply chain threat to industrial systems globally. In addition, the potential local output losses exacerbated by quality-based water scarcity can also transcend national borders and pose extra threats on distant economies (Lundqvist et al., 2008 ). Taking China as the case, Li et al. (2022)  used an input-output model to confirm that considering the constraints of water pollution on sectoral water use results in a twofold increase in the risk of economic losses attributed to water scarcity, as compared to scenarios solely considering water quantity. They found domestic trade would make economic risks of water scarcity more centralized in a few Northern provinces in China where available freshwater resources are already limited. In this regard, including water quality constraints into the mapping of water scarcity risk in the global trade network can more comprehensively unveil nations and sectors vulnerable to such impacts. Nevertheless, due to the lack of long time-series and high spatial resolution water quality datasets, prior studies have seldomly analyzed economic impacts of water scarcity on downstream sectors in instances where both water quantity and quality are considered. It prevents us from designing informed policy and management decisions aimed at safeguarding local water resources crucial to global supply chains. To fill these gaps, this study aims to reveal how water pollution may exacerbate the impacts of water scarcity on the local economic sectors and the global supply chain system over 1995∼2010. We chose 1995 as the beginning year of our assessment since the World Trade Organization officially commenced on this year, marking a strong acceleration of global trade. Three research questions are answered in this study: (1) Throughout the golden era of globalization, how has the evolution of water scarcity, both in terms of quantity and quality, unfolded in the major economies worldwide? (2) How does water pollution exacerbate economic risks associated with water scarcity at both the country and sector levels, and influence the dynamics of cascading virtual water scarcity risks within global trading networks? (3) In addressing SDG 6, how will the attainment of diverse progresses toward the clean water targets contribute to mitigating global economic water scarcity risks by the year 2030? To answer these questions, we report here on our quantification of the global quantity and quality related water scarcity index (WSI), its induced potential local economic water scarcity risk (WSR), and cascading virtual economic WSR over 1995∼2010. A machine learning-based long-series global water quality prediction dataset was used, covering three core constituents mentioned in SDG6.3.2, including electrical conductivity (EC), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total phosphorus (TP) at the grid-cell levels (∼50 km) (Desbureaux et al., 2022 ). We then modeled four scenarios to test if achieving SDG 6 targets could help mitigate potential economic water risks in the supply chains (Dumont et al., 2012 ; Herbert et al., 2015 ). Our analysis made the following three main contributions: First, methodologically, we propose a concise framework for economic WSR assessment, which combines quantity and quality related water scarcity together and is designed for easy applicability across different nations, river basins, and sectors. Second, our findings delineate the historical trends of quantity and quality related WSR, and identify key virtual risk exporters and importers, tracking their roles as they evolve alongside the expansion of global trade volume and changes in their positions within the trade structure. Third, our exploratory scenario-based models indicate that reductions to economic WSR will require concurrent local water management strategies encompassing both the conservation of water quantity and the enhancement of water quality. The implications of these results also extend to a global audience, emphasizing the imperative for collaborative sustainable water management practices focused on key nation-sectors to mitigate such risks.   2 Methods 2.1 Quality-related water scarcity index (WSI) based on SDG6.3.2 indicators To quantitatively measure the constraints of water pollution on country-level water scarcity, we first developed a quality-related water scarcity index (WSI). As shown in Eq. (1) , a common definition of quantity-related WSI (Feng et al., 2014 ; Jones et al., 2022 ; Liu et al., 2017 ) can be calculated as the ratio of the total amount of sectoral water consumption (D s , g    ) to water availability (Q g   ) in country g  .(1) W S I q u a n t i t y ,   g   =  ∑ s  D s , g    Q g        Based on that, following the method proposed by van Vliet et al. (2017) , the quality-related WSI is then calculated as the ratio of the sum of freshwater resources required for dilution to obtain adequate quality for all sectoral water uses (d q s , g     ) to water availability (Q g   ) in country g  , as shown in Eq. (2) .(2) W S I q u a l i t y ,   g   =    ∑ s  d q s , g    Q g        The method to determine d q s , g      is shown in Eq. (3) , where C i , m     is the actual concentration of water quality constituent i   in country g    and C m a x , s      represents the maximum water quality threshold for constituent i   in water use sector s  . We chose electrical conductivity (EC), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total phosphorous (TP) as three typical water quality constituents, which are also the core components of SDG6.3.2 indicators.(3) d q s , g    =  { 0 ,   C i  ≤  C m a x , s      D s , g   ( C i , s   C m a x ,  s    − 1  )  ,   C i  >  C m a x , s              We used more stringent international guidelines to set the water quality standards for sectoral use (Van Vliet et al., 2021 ). For the agricultural sector, we set a concentration threshold of 0.7 dS·m−1  for EC to reflect a salinity constraint on crop growth. For industrial and domestic sectors, we set 2.0 mg·L−1  for BOD and 0.2 mg·L−1  for TP to reflect the constraints of organic water pollution on manufacture and domestic use. The sum of quality and quantity-related WSI together reflect the ratio of total sectoral water consumptions of acceptable quality to the water availability in one country. It should be noted that both BOD and TP reflect the organic pollution levels in water bodies and their concentrations are always highly correlated (Mamun et al., 2021 ). If we sum sectoral water uses (d q s , g     ) for BOD and TP dilution simultaneously, it may cause double counting and overestimate quality-related water scarcity. Therefore, for industrial and domestic sectors, we only take the larger values of d q s , g      calculated based on either BOD or TP in each country. Regarding water quality datasets, due to the lack of high-quality monitoring networks at a global scale, we used an AI-based grid-level prediction database developed by Desbureaux et al. (2022) . The dataset was constructed using random forests (RFs) to predict six water quality indicators pertinent to SDG 6 at a global scale. The predictions were made at a monthly temporal scale spanning from 1992 to 2010 and with a resolution of 0.5° (∼50 km). Robust correlations were identified between the observed and predicted water quality, explaining 80∼95 % of the observed variability in the testing samples (Virro et al., 2021 ). This level of performance compares well to the efficacy of other process-based models. See Fig.S1 for the visualization of global water quality mapping. We matched the water quality data with another grid-level sectoral water use dataset, which distinguishes six water use sectors, i.e., irrigation, domestic, electricity generation, livestock, mining, and manufacturing (Huang et al., 2018 ). See Fig.S2 for the distribution of global sectoral water uses. We then calculated quality-related sectoral WSI at the 0.5-degree gird cell level, and summarized country-level average quality-related WSI weighted by each grid's annual water use. For annual water availability, we used the "total exploitable water resource  (km3 / year)", an indicator compiled by Food and Agriculture Organization to reflect the amount of water resources that are feasible for economic activities or environmental flow compensation (Aquastat, 2020 ). For countries without water availability data, we referred to the method of (Qu et al., 2018 ) to find a proxy value to represent. Environmental flow requirement for each country were set as a constant (20 %) and subtracted from the total water availability for each country. The change of WSI in different years is thus largely driven by the change in local water quantity and quality.  2.2 Local water scarcity risk assessment To quantify potential economic losses due to water scarcity, here we first built a local economic Water Scarcity Risk (WSR) index. As listed in Eq. (4) ,  local economic W S R m , g      measures the probability of direct output losses of sector s   in country g   due to local quantity-related and quality-related water scarcity. It includes three main parameters:(4) local  economic   W S R m , g   = f ( W S I g  ;  σ  )  × W D m , g   × k m , g        Water Scarcity Index (W S I g    ) measures country-level water scarcity (Liu et al., 2017 ). It contains either quantity-related WSI or quality-related WSI and the method for calculation has been clarified in the previous section. It should be noted that the value of Water Scarcity Index (WSI) is not equivalent to the probability of inducing economic losses. A country with WSI greater than one can still consume water via physical water transfer projects or undermining ecological water requirement. We could only assume that sectors in high-WSI regions are more at risk of reduced water use. Therefore, we applied a probabilistic function used by Qu et al. (2018)  to convert WSI to a value of which lie in the interval [0,1], as clarified in Eq. (5) .f ( W S  I g  ;  σ  )   = E ( Y g  )       With,(5) { Y g  = 0   if  X g  ≥ 1    Y g  = 1 − X g    if  X g  < 1      ,     X g  ∼  L o g n o r m a l  ( 1 W S  I g    , σ )          Here, f W D R     calculates the expected value of variable Y g   ,  which is the function of X g   . We assume the distribution of X g    is lognormal, with the median value being the availability-to-consumption at the country level (i.e., inverse of W S  I g    ) and standard deviation σ. Then, Y g    can be explained as reduced water consumption. When X g    ≥ 1, the water user can be supplied with adequate water and Y g    = 0. When X g    ≥ 1, the water user has to reduce water consumption by a fraction 1 - X g   . By this way, high-WSI regions are more at risk of reduced water use. The value of σ    was set as 1 in this study. Water Dependency (W D m , g     ) refers to the water resource reliance of sector m    in country g  , calculated by sector-level water intensity. We include this indicator because reduced clean water does not affect each sector equally and linearly. Some high water-intensity sectors (e.g. agriculture) are more sensitive to water shortage. In other word, this parameter reflects the sensitivity of each sector's economic activity to water scarcity. Therefore, the largest possible value of water dependency is assumed to be 1, in which case water is completely not substitutable. WD is not accessible from existing data and should be calculated from Water Intensity (WI). However, water intensity, defined as water consumption for unitary sectoral economic output, varies significantly across sectors and lie in [0, +∞). We therefore used the formula below to convert sectoral WI to sectoral WD, lying in [0.001, 1), as shown in Eq. (6) .(6) W D m  = f ( W I m  ;  α  )  = 1 1 + e  − α W I m    ( 1 0.001   − 1  )         Where, the W D m     denotes the degree of water resource dependence in sector m, which is the function of water intensity in sector m (W I m    ). We set α as 0.5 in this study. For nation-sectors with very low or even zero water intensity, their W D    values are at the minimum value of 0.001, reflecting the general importance of water resources. For nation-sectors with water intensity > 20 (ton/$), their W D    values will be very close to 1. The parameter α governs a cutoff value of WI above which W D    will rise rapidly toward 1. More technical details and uncertainty analysis can be found in Supporting Information (Li et al., 2022 ; Qu et al., 2018 ). Finally, parameter k m , g      refers to the benchmark economic output of sector m in country g   without considering the risk of water scarcity. It should be kept in mind that the transformation of WSI and WI does not change the relative level of water scarcity across countries and years. It only reflects the probability of reduced water use due to water scarcity and thus is measured in relative terms (i.e. in%). The value of local economic WSR is not equivalent to absolute economic losses, but only captures relative probability and the size of inducing economic losses for each country and sector. For water consumption by sectors, we adopted “blue water use ” (measured in 1000 m3 ) from the WIOD Environmental satellite account as the proxy value to represent the consumption of surface water and groundwater by the agricultural, industrial and household sectors (Genty et al., 2012 ). It is worth noticing that the available blue water use provided  in WIOD does not fully cover 35 sectors, but only for 10 major sectors, including Agriculture, Hunting, Forestry  and Fishing; Food, Beverages and Tobacco; Textiles and Textile Products; Pulp, Paper, Printing and Publishing; Chemicals and Chemical Product;, Other Non-Metallic Mineral; Basic Metals and Fabricated Metal; Electricity; Gas  and Water Supply ;, Education  and Health and Social Work  (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2011 )  2.3 Global trade modeling and virtual water scarcity risk assessment We then used the concept of cascading virtual economic water scarcity risk (WSR) to characterize the transmissions of upstream local economic WSR on downstream nations and sectors through reduced input supplies. We applied multiregional input-output (MRIO) analysis to map the virtual economic WSR exports and imports across nations. The use of MRIO analysis in this context is essential due to its capability to capture the intricate linkages between production and consumption activities across various regions and sectors, allowing for a holistic understanding of how water scarcity risk propagates. The model also aids in identifying hotspots, enabling the formulation of targeted strategies to enhance water-use efficiency and mitigate economic impacts (Chen and Chen, 2015 ). In the MRIO model, each country has its domestic supply chain system. Different regions in the world are connected by complex trade links, i.e. exports and imports across countries. The whole MRIO table, containing major global economies, has the characteristics of column and row balance, indicating that global total input equals its total output. For instance, as shown in Eq. (7) , each sector's total input equals the sum of its intermediate inputs and value added.(7) x = e Z + v      The 1 × n    vector x   represents total inputs of each nation-sector. The n × n    matrix Z   denotes transaction flows among different sectors of different nations. The 1 × n    vector v   denotes value-added creation in each nation-sector. Every element in the 1 × n    vector e   is equal to one. Then, to track the transmission of local economic risks through global trading system, we defined a n × n    matrix B as direct output coefficient matrix, representing the product allocation ratio from one country-sector to other country-sectors. The way to calculate matrix B is shown in Eq. (8) , where x ^    is the diagonalized matrix of total inputs vector x  .(8) B = ( x ^  )   − 1   Z      Accordingly, Eq. (7)  can be transformed into the form of Eq. (9) , where the n × n    matrix ( I − B  )  − 1      is the well-known Ghosh Inverse matrix. Each row in the matrix indicates the total outputs of sectors created by unitary value added in the sector represented by this row.(9) x = v ( I − B  )   − 1        Then, we simply replaced v   with local economic W S R   , as specified in Eq. (10) , and used Ghosh Inverse matrix to evaluate the influence of local water scarcity risk in the whole global supply chain networks. Elements in vector Δ  x    represent indirect, or, cascading output losses of each country-sector due to local economic WSR of all other country-sectors, namely the virtual water scarcity risks. To examine the impacts of quantity and quality-related water scarcity separately, we simply changed the type of local economic WSR.(10) Δ  x = l o c a l  e c o n o m i c  W S R × ( I − B  )   − 1        We can also diagonalize the vector Δ  x    and get a matrix Δ  X   , as shown in Eq. (11) . Elements in Δ  X    (i.e., Δ  x k l     ) stand for the impact of country-sector k's  quantity or quality-related local economic WSR on another country-sector l's  economic production.(11) Δ  X = diag ( l o c a l  e c o n o m i c  W S R  )  × ( I − B  )   − 1        Then, in Eq. (12) , by summing up Δ  x k l      per country, we derived n g h     , which represents the impact of country g’ local economic WSR on country h's economic outputs.(12) n g h   = ∑ k ∈ c o u n t r y  g    l ∈  c o u n t r y  h       Δ  x k l        Finally, to get the total values of local economic WSR exports and imports at the country level, we simply sum n g h     by column and by row respectively, as shown in Eq. (13)  and Eq. (14) . The virtual economic WSR import denotes cascading economic impacts in one country caused by the local water scarcity in other nations. The virtual economic WSR export reflects the impacts of local economic WSR in one country transmitted to other countries through exporting water-intensive goods (e.g., agricultural products) or industrial intermediate products.(13) v i r t u a l  e c o n o m i c  W S R g i m   = ∑ h ≠ g   n h g       (14) v i r t u a l  e c o n o m i c  W S R g e x   = ∑ g ≠ h   n g h        In terms of the MRIO table, this study used World Input-Output Database (WIOD) (Dietzenbacher et al., 2013 ; Timmer et al., 2015 ), which covers 27 members of the EU and 13 other major economies in the world (Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, the US etc.). These countries take up more than 85 % of world gross domestic product in 2010. The database covers 35 sectors for each country and has a complete temporal dimension from 1995 to 2010. The model has been validated to be representative of global trade markets (Timmer et al., 2015 ). WIOD provides environmental satellite account of water use, which gives the total amount of water consumption to produce outputs of goods and services in specific country-sectors. This enables us to estimate sector-level output losses due to inadequate water supply. To make price in MRIO comparable across years, we chose the 1995 as baseline year and converted all current price values in MRIO into fixed price values of 1995 using the double deflation methods (Malik et al., 2016 ).  2.4 Scenario design following the targets set by SDG6 To examine whether achieving SDG targets help to relieve global water scarcity risks, we designed four scenarios and projected local and cascading virtual economic WSR in 2030, referring to the targets of improving water quality and water use efficiency as initiated in SDG6. Table 1   provides descriptions of the baseline scenario and four SDG scenarios. In S1 Pessimistic Scenario (PES), we assumed that water quality in developing countries continuously gets deteriorated following the trend from 1995 to 2010. In addition, there will be no improvement in water use efficiency in all countries. Water demands will expand following the historical rate. We used linear regression models to simulate the increasing trend of water quality and water demand for each country, and projected the quantity and quality-related WSI in 2030 without any pollution control and technical investments. In S2 Improve Water Quality Scenario (IWQ), we followed the target in SDG6.3.2 that aims to halve proportion of untreated wastewater by 2030 globally. By 2030, we made a simplification and assumed that developed countries should improve water quality by 50 % compared to the baseline condition in 2010. For developing countries, the ratio of water quality deterioration will slow down and pollution concentrations will be halved by 50 % compared to the PES scenario. Water use efficiency will follow the assumption as is in PES scenario. In S3 Improve Water Use Efficiency Scenario (IWE), water use efficiency will follow a growth rate of 5–10 % every five years. This rate has been reported by several UN SDG tracking studies. We then projected future sectoral water use in 2030, assuming a fixed economic size and global trade structure. Water quality follows the parameters set in PES scenario. S4 Combined Strategy Scenario (IWQ + IWE) is the most optimistic condition, assuming SDG6 targets for both water quality and water use efficiency improvements will be achieved by 2030, and the parameters follow the settings in IWQ and IWE scenarios.  2.5 Herfindahl index for diversity assessment We chose the Herfindahl index, to measure the diversity of a country's upstream suppliers when importing virtual water scarcity risks in global supply chains. As shown Eq. (15) , n g h     denotes the impact of country h’ local economic WSR on country g's outputs. Therefore, H e r f g     indicates the concentration of virtual economic WSR imports from upstream suppliers for country g. Higher value indicates country g imports water-intensive goods from fewer nations, which means limited diversity of suppliers and may increase the country's vulnerability to water scarcity crisis happening in upstream suppliers.(15) H e r f g  =  ∑ h ≠ g   ( n h g   ∑ h ≠ g   n h g     )   2         3 Results 3.1 Trends of physical water scarcity risks on a global scale Fig. 1  A and Fig.S3, SI show the evolution trend of WSI (Quantity) and WSI (Quality + Quantity) from 1995 to 2010 in 40 global major economies. The classification criteria of developed and developing countries and their abbreviations are given in Table S5 and S4, SI. Overall, country-level WSI increased by a low of 5 % (e.g. Japan, Finland) to a high of more than 100 % (e.g. Belgium, UK) after including quality restriction in the assessment. By 2010, WSI (Quantity) and WSI (Quality + Quantity) exceeded an alerting threshold of 0.1 in 15 and 20 nations respectively. It suggests that inadequate water quality poses extra constraints on local physical water scarcity, but the extent varies dramatically across countries. The temporal trend of WSI changes from 1995 to 2010 also differs across countries. For most developing countries, both quantity and quality-related WSI grew over the past few decades, indicating increased water use and deteriorated water quality. For instance, WSI (Quality + Quantity) in China and India expanded from 0.18 to 0.35 (∼95 % increase) and from 0.27 to 0.41 (∼52 % increase) respectively. Regarding developed countries, quantity-related WSI increased in some countries, e.g. the US and Denmark, while declined in others, e.g. France and Australia. The magnitude of change was much smaller than developing countries. However, most of these advanced economies experienced decreased quality-related WSI, indicating alleviated water pollution issues. For instance, WSI (quantity) in the UK did not change but WSI (quality + quantity) declined ∼30 % owing to improved water quality. By 2010, India, China, and the Southern Europe have become the hotspot regions of water scarcity. We then calculated potential local sectoral output losses due to water scarcity, i.e. local economic WSR. Fig. 1 B presents the temporal shifts in country-level WSI and local economic WSR (Quantity + Quality) over 1995–2010. Fig.S4, SI shows annual changes in local economic WSR for the top ten nations who face the greatest risks. Our results show that during the fast globalization period from 1995 to 2010, global local economic WSR surged by more than threefold in volume from 97 to 340 billion USD. The ratio of quality-related local economic WSR also risen from 23.1 % to 31.5 % over this period. The physical water risk WSI and related economic WSR ascended simultaneously in nine of the ten developing countries except Romania. It indicates that most developing countries expanded their scale of economies during the globalization process, but also depleted physical water resources and sacrificed local water quality. For example, China suffered the largest rises in local economic WSR, reaching above 100 billion US dollars of potential output losses in 2010, accounting for nearly one third of the global total economic risk. Many high-income countries witnessed mitigation in WSI or local economic WSR, such as France, Japan, Germany, Netherlands, Australia, Cyprus, and Malta. In general, developed countries achieved more progresses in realizing the Sustainable Development Goals along with the expansion of global markets.  3.2 Mapping water scarcity risk transfers in global trade networks To trace the transmission of local water scarcity risk along global supply chains, we quantified economic risks embedded in a nation's imports and exports of water-intensive goods, so called cascading virtual economic WSR. Exporters of virtual economic WSR produce cascading economic impacts on downstream nation-sectors. Importers of virtual economic WSR, on the contrary, are vulnerable to distant upstream countries’ output losses induced by local water scarcity. From 1995 to 2010, we find the absolute values and ranks of exported and imported cascading virtual economic WSR in major nations significantly changed. As shown in Fig. 2  A, the US and France were the largest virtual economic WSR exporters in 1995. As of 2010, China ascended to the top position, surpassing that of the United States by over threefold. Virtual economic WSR exports in developing countries India and Turkey kept growing and ranked top five in the world, while the rankings of European nations such as Spain, France and Germany slightly dropped. Quality-related water scarcity amplified virtual economic WSR exports in most countries. In the context of China, the value of quality-included virtual economic WSR exports almost doubled compared to that considering only quantity-based water scarcity, reaching ∼35.6 billion USD. Fig. 2 B illustrates the shifts in primary recipients of cascading virtual economic WSR imports from 1995 to 2010. Initially, in 1995, these importers were distributed widely across global markets, with major economies such as the US, Japan, Germany, Italy, and the UK leading in virtual economic WSR imports. Notably, when accounting for water quality, the values of cascading virtual economic WSR imports in these nations increased, as they imported a substantial quantity of goods from developing countries where pollution issues are more pronounced. By 2010, virtual economic WSR importers became more concentrated. The US remained the largest cascading virtual economic WSR importer (∼17.7 billion USD) while China has risen to the second place (∼8.3 billion USD). These patterns reflect that China is playing a more central role in global trade networks in 2010 compared to 1995. Maps in Fig. 2 C and D further show that water pollution changes the landscape of water scarcity risk transfers across borders. The shares of quality-related virtual economic WSR exports increased for most developing countries from 1995 to 2010, including China and India, but dropped slightly in most European countries. On the contrary, the shares of quality-related virtual economic WSR imports expanded almost for all countries, indicating that highly interdependent global trade networks enable local water pollution issues to exert impacts on a global scale. The ring charts present the main destination and source countries of cascading virtual economic WSR for top exporters and importers. Full virtual economic WSR flows across all 40 economies can be found in Fig.S6, SI. In 1995, transfers of virtual water scarcity risks were relatively scattered across regions. For example, in Asia, a great amount of virtual economic WSR from India and China flowed into Japan and the US. Europe, France and the US were the main source countries of cascading virtual economic WSR, whereas Italy, the UK and Germany were main importers of cascading virtual economic WSR. By 2010, the role of China and India in global economy became more prominent due to their increasing participation in global good market. China turned to be the largest source of cascading virtual economic WSR for almost all the main economies in the world. Closely linked trade networks also made China the most popular cascading virtual economic WSR export destination for other countries. In view of rising dependency on Chinese imports, addressing local water scarcity and pollution issues in China is critical for increasing resilience in global trade networks against cascading virtual economic WSR transfers.  3.3 Potential to mitigate economic risks by achieving SDG 6 To explore how efforts to achieve SDG 6 may relieve global water scarcity risks, we projected local economic WSR and cascading virtual economic WSR to 2030 under four water management scenarios (Table 1 ) according to specific SDG6 targets, assuming a fixed economic size and global trade structure as is in year 2010. Here we considered: (1) a Pessimistic Business-as-usual Scenario (S1-PES), which assumes a deteriorating trend of water quality especially in developing countries and consistently increasing global water consumption. (2) a Water Quality Improvement scenario (S2-IWQ), which refers to the target of SDG6.3 committed to halve the proportion of global untreated wastewater by 2030. We made an optimistic simplification, assuming that pollution concentration in water bodies will be halved in 2030 for all countries. (3) a Water Use Efficiency Improvement Scenario (S3-IWE), which sets a 10–20 % increase in water use efficiency for each country per decade, according to the latest FAO SDG Tracking Report (Water, 2021 ). (4) a Combined SDG Targets Scenario (S4-IWQ+IWE), follows quality and efficiency improvement as specified in S2 and S3. Compared to a ‘baseline scenario’ S0, that is the baseline water scarcity risks in 2010, our projection shows that global local economic WSR and cascading virtual economic WSR may increase 36.8 % and 34.0 % in S1-PES without any clean water or water-saving initiatives (Fig. 3  A and Fig. 3 B). Quality-related local and virtual economic WSR account for about 30 % of the total amount at the global scale. In the Water Quality Improvement Scenario (S2-IWQ), projections still show 13.3 % and 12.7 % increase in local and cascading virtual economic WSR compared to S0. It indicates that controlling water pollution alone cannot fully address water scarcity challenges. Improving water use efficiency in S3-IWE may help relieve local and cascading virtual economic WSR by 6.9 % and 3.0 % compared to S0. This might be because improving water use efficiency not only reduces water demand for sectoral production but also mitigates quality-related water scarcity as it needs less water to dilute pollution. Finally, in the most optimistic scenario (S4-IWQ+IWE), ambitious progress on both water quality and efficiency improvement help to relieve 20.9 % local economic WSR and 20.0 % cascading virtual economic WSR globally. A country-level analysis shows that Brazil, Mexico, China, Latvia, and Belgium have the largest potentials to reduce virtual economic WSR exports more than 45 % in scenario S4 compared to the most pessimistic scenario S1 (Fig.S8 and Fig.S9). Countries like Australia, Canada, Indonesia, South Korea, Japan, and the US can gain more benefits from global SDG6 achievement, as their imports of virtual economic WSR can be cut down more than 40 % by 2030. In addition to bettering local water management, identifying vulnerable supply chains and adjusting global trade structure are alternative options to adapt to water scarcity risks. If a country relies on water-intensive goods (e.g., agricultural, food, and textile products) from only a few upstream nations, it will be less resilient to concurrent water scarcity crisis happening in these upstream economies, as it takes time to switch to other suppliers. Here we used the Herfindahl index to measure a country's concentration of virtual economic WSR imports from upstream trade partners. A higher score indicates that a country imports from very few origins and is thus more vulnerable to foreign water scarcity in the global trade system. Fig. 3 C shows Herfindahl index of cascading virtual economic WSR for 40 major economies in S1 and S4 scenarios. We find that India, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Mexico, and Turkey are the most vulnerable countries in the face of water scarcity in distant foreign economies. The inclusion of water quality constraints leads to extra 0.02∼0.08 point higher Herfindahl index and exacerbates resilience in these countries. It indicates that they heavily rely on goods from nations with both higher water scarcity and low water quality. Compared to the scenario S1, most countries will have 0.02∼0.06 lower Herfindahl scores under the scenario S4. It suggests that achieving SDG 6 helps to increase global supply chain resilience toward water scarcity. In the meanwhile, enriching the diversity of upstream trade partnerships is another key strategy for importers to counteract the cascading economic water scarcity risks.   4 Discussions In this study, we have introduced a concise assessment framework designed to evaluate the hidden economic risks associated with both quality and quantity-related water scarcity on a global scale. The framework integrates techniques including global gridded water scarcity mapping, sector-specific quality-related water scarcity indexing, probability-based economic risk assessment, and multi-regional input-output modeling. High-resolution spatial-temporal mappings of water pollution and water use significantly enhance the assessment of quality-related water scarcity at both the grid-cell and sector levels. Utilizing sectoral water use standards for assessing water quality constraints is proven to be a more reasonable approach for evaluating potential economic impacts and comparison between regions and countries. The probability-based transformation of WSI is also proved to be efficient. An alerting threshold of 0.1 in WSI corresponds to ∼1–3 % potential economic output losses from main water-use sectors (Russ et al., 2022 ), which is aligned with evidence from previous empirical studies. Integrating the framework with input-output model helps identify critical sectors within domestic or international supply chain networks for effective risk mitigation. Overall, we have established a research linkage encompassing local water quality, water scarcity, economic risk, and supply chain transmission. This framework can be easily applicable in other regions or river basins, allowing for the monitoring of the evolution of quality-related water scarcity and its associated hidden economic risks. Our findings align with recent studies addressing water scarcity related to quality and its economic impacts, revealing patterns not fully displayed in earlier research. Van Vliet et al. (2021)  identified global hotspots of water scarcity driven by both surface water quantity and water quality issues, using a monthly time step and focusing on the period 2000–2010. They observed that incorporating water quality considerations increases the percentage of the world's population experiencing severe water scarcity from an annual average of 30 % to 40 %. The impacts on water quality are particularly pronounced in regions already facing severe water scarcity, such as Eastern China and India. Our estimates also indicate that, when accounting for quality constraints, the global total local economic WSR will increase by about one-third, rising from 27 billion to 38 billion in 2010. We further identify an imbalance in the growth of quality-related economic WSR across regions, with developing countries experiencing a disproportionately higher increase in hidden risks. Concerning the transfer of WSR in the global market, numerous studies highlight how virtual water trade reshapes global water scarcity patterns, with major manufacturing countries like China emerging as the largest exporter of WSR during periods of rapid globalization (Qu et al., 2018 ; Wan et al., 2016 ). Our findings support this perspective, revealing that water pollution amplifies the size of WSR exports and imports in major economies, influencing the rankings of vulnerability levels among countries. Looking ahead, studies emphasize the imperative of simultaneously considering quantity and quality for sustainable water management. A recent spatially-explicit process-based model simulation study concludes that achieving SDG6.3 reduces water pollution but falls short of improving ambient water quality to below key concentration thresholds in several world regions (Jones et al., 2023 ). Strategies addressing both quantity and quality shortages, such as expanding desalination, enhancing water productivity, and increasing treated wastewater reuse, must be strongly considered to mitigate water scarcity levels (Rosa et al., 2020 ; Silva, 2023 ; Van Vliet et al., 2021 ). From a more strictly economic standpoint, our study affirms the benefits of concurrently conserving water and improving water quality to alleviate WSR. It also underscores the necessity for countries to collaborate in combating the costs of pollution, as clean water is becoming a scarce resource distributed unevenly due to the deepening global division of labor. The findings of this study also have practical implications that resonate on a global scale, offering actionable information and potential solutions with broad applicability across various regions and contexts. For example, this study highlights that while a country can alleviate local economic WSR by conserving water resources and managing water pollution, the overall magnitude of economic WSR may still expand due to substantial imports of virtual economic WSR from distant economies facing water quality deterioration. Thus, attaining clean water goals requires a global, rather than solely a local, collaborative effort to address economic security issues. Between 1995 and 2010, quality-related water scarcity has largely been relieved in most developed countries due to ongoing efforts to control water pollution under the SDG6 initiative (Coordination ; Kümmerer et al., 2018 ). However, local water crisis can transfer to distant economies through the trade-connected supply chains. Most developing countries, such as India, China, and Mexico, experienced expanding economic scales but also suffered depletion of water resources and deteriorated water quality simultaneously. As such, the US has sustained its position with the highest virtual economic WSR imports, significantly outpacing other countries, due to its robust economic interdependencies with nations exporting water-intensive goods. It underscores the needs for nations from upstream and downstream supply chains to conserve water resources and tackle water pollution issues collaboratively. Policymakers in countries heavily reliant on water-intensive goods exports should prioritize safeguarding the capacity to provide water of adequate quality for various production activities (Hoekstra et al., 2012 ; Ma et al., 2020 ; Vanham et al., 2018 ). Using Herfindahl Index as a measurement of the concentrations of virtual economic WSR imports from upstream countries, our findings show that water pollution decreases overall supply chain resilience in the global trade system. Besides improving water quality and relieving water scarcity in major exporters, another approach to avoid a concurrent upstream water crisis is to increase the diversity of trade networks and detach dependency on importing water-intensive goods from limited trade partners. In addition, hotspot sectors of cascading virtual economic WSR exports and imports (see Table S6) identified in the supply chain lay a foundation for nations to promote water security and mitigate cascading economic losses from a micro perspective (Organization, 2014 ; Supply and Programme, 2015 ). For example, in 2010, the sectors Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing  and Electricity, Gas and Water Supply  in China and India were key exporters of virtual economic WSR. Food, Beverages and Tobacco, Construction , and Electrical and Optical Equipment  in the US were the major receptions of virtual economic WSR. More targeted and tailored strategies are required in these key sectors in order to mitigate transboundary risk transmissions. We acknowledge several limitations in this study. Firstly, we adopted a machine learning-based water quality prediction dataset due to the lack of global long-term water quality monitoring records for some regions (e.g. Africa and Central Asia) coupled with the somewhat dated time period. However, through systematic dataset reviews, we determined that the chosen period is the most suitable for analysis. This decision is based on the optimal alignment of the global water quality, water use, and input-output datasets used in this study, ensuring a harmonized match from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Besides, our assessment has been limited to a selection of water quality constituents (i.e. salinity, total phosphorous and biochemical oxygen demand). These are core water quality constituents involved in SDG 6.3.2 and were selected due to their relevance for sectoral uses and ecosystems. It should be acknowledged that some other water quality issues also pose constraints on sectoral activities, but were not examined in this study. For example, high water temperature disrupts thermoelectric power plants by reducing available cooling water (van Vliet et al., 2017 ). In addition, there are also many emerging hazards such as microplastics and pathogen pollution which may threaten ecosystem and human health, but the levels of potential damages and social costs are largely unknown. Our assessment framework provides a reference for incorporating water pollution into the assessment of economic risks arising from water scarcity. A more comprehensive analysis should consider broader effects of water pollution, for example, lowering public health (Bhuyan, 2022 ), shortening service life of facilities, and decreasing food quality (Lin et al., 2022 ; Liu et al., 2023 ), which are not covered here in this study. The second limitation may come from the water scarcity index. When calculating blue water usage, the agricultural sector did not account for green water in this study. When green water is insufficient for currently rain-fed croplands to sustain crop production, blue water is needed for irrigation to boost yields to complement green water deficit. Therefore, excluding green water may lead to some bias in estimating agricultural water scarcity because there might be green water deficits in some regions due to climate events such as drought. In recent year, some scholars attempt to combine green and blue water in an integrated water scarcity assessment (Liu et al., 2022 ; Rosa et al., 2020 ). Existing studies has yet to achieve uniformity in terms of definitions and assessment methods, but a general consensus is that, when considering green water scarcity, the global pattern of water scarcity becomes more complicated, with a trend toward increased severity. Thirdly, the absence of reliable high-resolution sectoral water use data introduces potential uncertainties. To enhance the spatial resolution of both quantity and quality-related water scarcity assessments, we utilized water use maps (∼50 km) to compute water scarcity at the grid-cell level before aggregating to the country level. However, the spatial water use dataset only encompasses six major water use sectors, while the Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) model includes 35 sectors, with blue water use data available for only 10 sectors. Consequently, we manually established correspondences between these sectors and assumed that the sectors in MRIO share the same water scarcity risks as their counterparts calculated based on the grid-cell maps. This assumption may introduce biases. With better data resolution and expanded input-output tables, we can pinpoint quality-related water scarcity risks in specific sectors, enabling more precise and targeted strategies.  5 Conclusion In this study, we introduced an integrated assessment framework, and estimated both quality and quantity-related Water Scarcity Index (WSI), local economic water scarcity risk (WSR), and the cascading virtual WSR observed in global trade markets across 40 major economies spanning from 1995 to 2010. Results show that developing countries had rapid growth in both quantity and quality-related WSI, while major developed economies experienced a modest increase in water stress but mitigated quality-related risks, suggesting imbalanced progress towards SDG 6 across countries. Then, local economic WSR increased from $116 billion to $380 billion, with quality-related risks escalating from 20 % to 30 %. Virtual economic WSR in global supply chains rose from $39 billion to $160 billion, with quality-related risks increasing from 19 % to 27 %. China emerged as the leading exporter of economic WSR, surpassing the US, France, and Japan, and secured the second-largest position as an importer, following closely behind the US. To examine whether achieving SDG targets help to relieve global WSR, we designed four scenarios and projected local and cascading virtual economic WSR in 2030, referring to the targets of improving water quality and water use efficiency as initiated in SDG 6. The findings indicate that the most ambitious advancements in both water quality and water use efficiency can alleviate ∼20 % of the global economic WSR. Our findings suggest that incorporating water quality into assessments enhances the precision in identifying vulnerable sectors and regions with elevated water scarcity and economic WSR. Additionally, strategies encompassing the management of untreated wastewater flows, enhanced water use efficiency, and diversification of supply chain networks are pivotal to fully achieve SDG 6 and strengthen global economic resilience against forthcoming water challenges.
