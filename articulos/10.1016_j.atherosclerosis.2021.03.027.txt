From the EAS  Latest European Atherosclerosis Society statement reaffirms commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030 Agenda Jane K. Stock  European Atherosclerosis Society, World Trade Center Göteborg, Mässans Gata 10, SE-412 51, Göteborg, Sweden European Atherosclerosis Society World Trade Center Göteborg Mässans Gata 10 Göteborg SE-412 51 Sweden  European Atherosclerosis Society, World Trade Center Goteborg, Massans Gata 10, SE-412 51, Goteborg, Sweden     Keywords EAS  UN  Goals  2030  Agenda    The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development 2030 Agenda targets 17 goals critical for the sustainability of the planet. This initiative was adopted by all UN member states in 2015, aiming to end poverty, protect the planet, and improve the lives and prospects for all [1 ]. With less than 10 years remaining, urgent action is needed if these goals are to be met. In a recent statement [2 ], the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) reaffirmed its commitment to the 2030 Agenda Goals, in particular Sustainable Development Goal 3, which targets at least 30% reduction in premature mortality due to noncommunicable disease (NCD) by 2030. NCDs are the major cause of premature morbidity, disability and mortality worldwide, disproportionately impacting low- and middle-income countries, as almost 75% of all NCD deaths – including over 80% of premature deaths from NCDs - occur here [3 ]. This in turn jeopardises the affordability of healthcare, and achievement of universal health coverage, another tenet of Goal 3. Cardiovascular diseases represent the major contributor to NCD deaths [4 ]. Worryingly, cardiovascular disease incidence is increasing, almost doubling between 2009 and 2019 [4 ]. Of these, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) – ischaemic heart disease and stroke -is most prevalent; in 2019, ASCVD was responsible for about one-third of all deaths, with more than one in 20 in individuals younger than 50 years [4 ]. This escalation in ASCVD is largely driven by major modifiable risk factors, in particular high body mass index (BMI), high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and poor diet, all of which are becoming more common globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries, in concert with increasing urbanisation [4 ]. The European perspective illustrates why the increasing prevalence of metabolic risk is such an issue. Whereas Europe has demonstrated significant improvement in ASCVD mortality over the last few decades, by combatting smoking and treating high cholesterol and high blood pressure, escalating rates of obesity and diabetes, consequences of an increasingly sedentary lifestyle and poor diet, put this at risk. Indeed, while diabetes affects 3.9% of the global population, the prevalence is almost double (7.3%) in Europe [5 ]. Admittedly, Europe is not homogeneous, as countries are at different stages of economic transition. Despite this, it is evident that poor lifestyle choices and increasing metabolic risk are undermining the gains in cardiovascular health. Latest data from the EUROASPIRE V survey clearly illustrate this, with nearly half of high-risk patients in primary care in 16 European countries identified as obese (i.e., BMI ≥30 kg/m2 ) and nearly two-thirds centrally obese. There was also inadequate control of blood pressure, lipids, and diabetes [6 ]. 1 The EAS: a key player in the 2030 Agenda Given this scenario, the EAS has a valuable role to play. Indeed, the EAS was founded with the mission to advance and exchange knowledge on the causes, risk factors, prevention, and treatment of ASCVD. Now in its 89th Congress year, the EAS is even more relevant in achieving the 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goal 3. The activities of the EAS extend across the central pillars of research, education, and advocacy. Key initiatives include the EAS consensus panel and task force statements, which provide critical appraisals of the latest evidence for lipoprotein-related risk factors and their association with ASCVD [7–9 ]. These have been foundational for guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia [10 ], in partnership with the European Society of Cardiology. Consensus-led initiatives have also proved integral to the development of research registries such as the EAS Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) Studies Collaboration [11 ], and more recently, the Lipid Clinics Network project, which aims to establish uniform European Union-wide standards of diagnosis, management, and treatment of patients with lipid disorders, as well as inform on rare dyslipidaemias [12 ]. Furthermore, the remit of the EAS extends beyond Europe, particularly in its advocacy role. One example of this is the recent ‘Call to Action on FH’ aiming to improve FH care worldwide [13 ]. Additionally, the EAS provides grants to researchers and clinicians in middle- and lower-income regions to ensure wider access to accredited EAS educational programmes.  2 SMART approaches are the key In the 21st century, especially in the context of this COVID-19 pandemic, new thinking is needed for implementation strategies to ensure the 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goal 3 is met. SMART approaches are essential to optimising use of the EAS resources for improved global health. Digital health tools, which are readily available on smart phones, and improved information technology offer practical and sustainable approaches to improving access to educational programmes for ASCVD prevention. In Europe and beyond, SMART approaches are also instrumental in optimising treatment strategies, to ensure that more costly therapeutic options are targeted to individuals most at risk of ASCVD. Such approaches are particularly relevant for middle- and lower-income countries, where affordability is an over-riding concern for healthcare delivery. The clock is ticking. This latest EAS statement reaffirms the global role of the EAS in fulfilling the 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goal 3. Collaboration and communication provide the keys to lever actions to improve the health of all.
