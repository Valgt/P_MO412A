                  With limited time to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the world needs effective, scalable approaches to measure and monitor global progress toward the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Given that many SDGs are closely related to the environment in which people live, satellite data are commonly used for SDG assessment, but they are only based on a top-down view and have inherent technical issues (e.g., insufficient spatial resolution and cloud coverage). In recent years, street view imagery (SVI), as an emerging source of remote sensing data, has been an indispensable supplement to monitor SDGs, by recording the environment from an eye-level view. However, the systematic and comprehensive understanding of SVI applications to promote SDGs is insufficient. We reviewed SVI-related studies of SDGs and found that SVI is mainly used for good health and well-being (SDG 3), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), zero hunger (SDG 2), and climate action (SDG 13). The SVI-based greenery view index was the most common element feature related to SDGs. The SVI-derived human perception features were also often used to assess SDG 3 and SDG 11. Future studies may further investigate the potential mechanisms between SVI-based features and SDGs. This review provides a comprehensive summary and guidance for governments and scholars worldwide to assess SDGs based on SVI in the future.

With limited time to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the world needs effective, scalable approaches to measure and monitor global progress toward the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Given that many SDGs are closely related to the environment in which people live, satellite data are commonly used for SDG assessment, but they are only based on a top-down view and have inherent technical issues (e.g., insufficient spatial resolution and cloud coverage). In recent years, street view imagery (SVI), as an emerging source of remote sensing data, has been an indispensable supplement to monitor SDGs, by recording the environment from an eye-level view. However, the systematic and comprehensive understanding of SVI applications to promote SDGs is insufficient. We reviewed SVI-related studies of SDGs and found that SVI is mainly used for good health and well-being (SDG 3), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), zero hunger (SDG 2), and climate action (SDG 13). The SVI-based greenery view index was the most common element feature related to SDGs. The SVI-derived human perception features were also often used to assess SDG 3 and SDG 11. Future studies may further investigate the potential mechanisms between SVI-based features and SDGs. This review provides a comprehensive summary and guidance for governments and scholars worldwide to assess SDGs based on SVI in the future.   Keywords Sustainable Development Goal  Street view image  Environment monitoring  Greenness  Systematic review  Green space  Health geography  Spatial epidemiology   Data availability Data will be made available on request.   1 Introduction Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), endorsed by the United Nations (UN) in 2015, set out to address global challenges, such as global health, climate change, human settlement, and inequality (Desa, 2016 ), to promote global social, economic, and environmental development. With 17 SDGs and 169 targets expected to be met by 2030, the world must rationally measure progress towards these goals to better understand where we are and what is next on the pathway to SDGs (Adams and Judd, 2016; Xu et al., 2020 ). SDG monitoring and promotion are great challenges even for many developed countries over the world. As of February 2022, almost 40 % of SDG indicators are difficult to track regularly in more than half of countries (IAEG-SDGs, 2022 ). Therefore, it is urgent to develop appropriate approaches to monitor and promote SDGs efficiently on a large scale (Paganini et al., 2018 ). Remote sensing data are indispensable for the environment and hence SDG monitoring and improvement (Giuliani et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2019a ), as 8 of 17 SDGs are closely related to the human living environment (CEOS and ESA, 2018 ). Specifically, about 40 of the 169 SDG targets and 30 of the 232 SDG indicators can be assessed by remote sensing data. Compared to traditional approaches to obtain environmental data (e.g., field surveys, questionnaires, and government statistics), remote sensing data provide more accurate, more frequent, and higher quality monitoring for various environments on larger scales (Jia et al., 2019a; Jia and Stein, 2017; Zou and Wang, 2022 ). Satellite data are the major type of remote sensing data that can support assessments of multiple SDGs (CEOS and ESA, 2018; Holloway and Mengersen, 2018; Jia et al., 2019b ). However, satellite data, if used alone, have limitations due to its top-down view and inherit technical issues (e.g., insufficient spatial resolution and cloud coverage) which may affect results of SDG-related analysis. Street view imagery (SVI), as an emerging source of remote sensing data, can record the environment from an eye-level view and has been a necessary supplement to satellite data with regard to SDG monitoring (Jia, 2021; Kang et al., 2020; Rundle et al., 2011 ). For example, SVI can capture fine-grained features of the neighborhood environment, including objective visual elements (e.g., greenness, blue sky), and reflect subjective human perceptions (e.g., safety, depressed feelings), which are close to good health and well-being (SDG 3) (Yang et al., 2019 ) and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11) (Fu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022 ). Moreover, SVI can reflect the spatial pattern of buildings, which is related to urban air corridors and land surface temperature that can contribute to combating climate change and its impacts (SDG 13) (Du et al., 2020; Zhang et al. 2019c ). Despite the growing research applications of SVI, the literature does not provide a systematic and comprehensive understanding of SVI applications to achieve SDGs, which hampers us from making better use of this new data for SDG monitoring and improvements. To fill the aforementioned gap, this study aimed to systematically review SVI-related studies towards SDGs. In particular, we wanted to answer three research questions: 1) Which SDGs can be assessed from SVI? 2) Which SVI-based features are valuable to SDGs? and 3) Which evidence has been found thatabout the roles of SVI-based features in promoting SDGs? This review emphasized the values of the eye-level view of SVI to certain SDGs. Our findings would consolidate the usefulness and illuminate more potential of SVI for monitoring and promoting SDGs, and also provide guidance for research in the fields of, for example, health geography, spatial epidemiology, and environmental health, which intends to understand associations between the environment and SDGs.  2 Methods We performed a topic search regarding 17 SDGs and SVI in the Web of Science database on 1st May 2022 (Table 1  ). Although the 2030 Agenda was launched in 2015, some studies published before 2015 were also included as the UN and some countries have devoted their efforts to promoting sustainable development since 1992 (Desa, 2016 ). We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-Analyses (Liberati et al., 2009 ) for the study selection (Fig. 1  ). We identified 783 records for the initial review. After reviewing the titles and abstracts of these records, we excluded 392 irrelevant articles, and 391 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Considering that deep learning is the mainstream method in image processing (He and Li, 2021 ), we particularly focused on studies using this method on SVI toward one or more SDGs. In the end, we included 147 studies in this review with the following features tabulated: first author, publication year, study area, SVI-related SDGs, targets of SDGs, SDG indicators, SVI-based features, SVI data sources, and SVI exacted methods.  3 Results 3.1 Characteristics of the included studies Among all included studies, SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 3 (good health and well-being), 13 (climate change), and 2 (zero hunger) are the four main goals directly supported by SVI (Fig. 2  ). Among all the targets of SDG 11, urban planning (Target 11.3) accounts for the largest proportion of studies; 41 out of 42 studies of SDG 3 focus on non-communicable diseases, and only one study addresses communicable diseases; eight studies focus on climate change and two on crop monitoring. The selected studies were conducted in 18 countries, mainly from Asia and North America, and no studies were conducted in Africa ( Fig. 3  ) . China and the United States (US) are the top two study areas. The studies in China mainly focus on SDG 11 (n = 37) and 3 (n = 27), among which there are five studies on SDG 13. The proportions of research topics conducted in the US showed a similar pattern (30 on SDG 11, 10 on SDG 3, and one on SDG 13), including one study on SDG 2. Studies mainly focus on SDG 11 in other countries. In addition, almost all studies were conducted at the neighborhood and city scales, with only a few at the country scale.  3.2 SDGs and related variables Table 2   summarizes the contents of these four SDGs and the corresponding variables adopted in the included studies. SDG 11 is the most frequently studied topic, followed up by SDG 3. Nearly all targets of SDG 11 have been studied, including safe housing, safe transportation, urban planning, disaster management, pollution management, green and public space planning, and regional socioeconomics (Fang et al., 2020; Gebru et al., 2017; Law et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019a ). Many studies adopted SVI to measure these crucial aspects of the neighborhood environment. For example, the crime rate (Zhang et al., 2019a ) and housing price (Law et al., 2019 ) are the main variables associated with safe and affordable housing (Target 11.1). The well-studied targets of SDG 3 include the burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. The number of COVID-19 cases (Nguyen et al., 2020 ) is the variable of communicable diseases (Target 3.3). Encouraging physical activity (Lu, 2019 ), preventing obesity and its relevant chronic disease (Nguyen et al. 2021b; Xiao et al., 2021 ), and improving mental health (Wang et al., 2019e ) are major concerns of improving non-communicable diseases (Target 3.4).  3.3 SVI-based features SVI contains diverse environmental information. Previous work (Y. Kang et al., 2020 ) concludes that street elements and overall scenes are two key aspects to represent the neighborhood environment that SVI captures. The included studies also show that human perceptions and abstract information are important to understand SDGs. Hence, we conclude four SVI-based features, namely, element, scene, perception, and abstract features. Element features   reflect the physical characteristics of street objects, including the presence or absence of the feature, the area proportion in the field of view, and other attributes. Existing studies have focused on determining the presence or absence of four types of street objects, including walkability, transportation, neighborhood physical disorder, and other objects. In addition to the existence of visual objects, the area proportion of the target objects in the field of view, namely street-view indexes, is also a standard feature derived from SVI. Green view, sky view, building view, and some composite street view indexes were the most frequently used indicators. Other attributes, such as crop type, tree species, and car model, can also be directly recognized from SVI. Scene features   are people’s objective evaluation of street elements or street scene semantics. For example, land parcels are categorized into various types indicating their main services and functions, such as commercial and residential land cover; A salient scene referred to distinguishing skyscrapers or landmarks that could instantly attract people’s attention (Guan et al., 2020 ). Perception features   capture people’s subjective perceptions about the built environment, such as safety, wealth, liveliness, depression, boredom, and beauty (Yao et al., 2019 ). The Place Pulse dataset (Dubey et al., 2016 ) is the key to extracting subjective perceptions on SVI. This dataset contains over 110 thousand street view images from 56 cities and, more importantly, one million pairwise comparisons along six perceptions conducted by volunteers. Therefore, this dataset is useful to predict some common human perceptions of SVI captured anywhere. Abstract features   refer to abstract image features that cannot be directly observed by humans but can be extracted from SVI by deep learning or artificial intelligence. An abstract feature learned by deep learning architectures can be directly used in an end-to-end model to predict relevant outcomes, such as housing prices (Law et al., 2019 ) and the volume of taxi trips (Zhang et al., 2019a ). Fig. 4   summarizes specific features of each group adopted in included studies. Moreover, three methods are commonly used to extract SVI-based features, which are classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. The classification   method categorizes images into classes of interest (Rawat and Wang, 2017 ), which can help distinguish whether one SVI belongs to a specific class (e.g., leafy residences and commercial districts). The semantic segmentation   method assigns labels of semantic categories (e.g., tree, sky, car) to each pixel of an image (Yu et al., 2018 ). It can result in various street-view indexes. The object detection   method determines whether particular objects (e.g., traffic signs, trees, trash cans, etc.) exist in an image and, if yes, returns their spatial location and extent (Liu et al. 2020a ). It can detect the presence of street objects, such as cars, pedestrians, and road defects.  3.4 Associations between SVI-based features and SDG-related variables The associations between SDGs and SVI-based features vary. Table 3   summarizes key SDG variables, SVI-based features, and potential pathways to link them together and the supplementary Table S1  shows the record for each study. SDG 3 and SDG 11 are intensively related to a large number of SVI-based features, while SDG 13 and SDG 2 involve fewer features. Among involved features, the green view index (GVI) is the most popular feature, accounting for approximately half of studies, and most of them belong to SDG 3 and SDG 11. Besides, Table 3  also summarizes key potential pathways through which SVI-based features may influence SDGs. Evidence regarding these associations and potential pathways could guide future actions to achieve SDGs. 3.4.1 SDG 3: Good health and well-being SVI-based features have been proven to directly or indirectly affect human behavior and health outcomes in a variety of ways. Different SVI-based features may jointly shape the function and characteristics of the community, which may further affect the health behaviors and health status of residents (Li et al., 2022 ). 3.4.1.1 Physical activity Numerous empirical studies have suggested that the urban physcial environment can affect the level of physical activity (PA), and a higher level of PA brings beneficial effects to overall health. Walking, jogging, and cycling are common PA in the included studies. A walking-friendly neighborhood environment, characterized by more greenery (He et al., 2020 ) and crosswalks (Koo et al., 2022 ), can increase the level of PA by encouraging walking (Ki and Lee, 2021; Koo et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2019b ). On contrary, neighborhood physical disorder features (e.g., single-lane roads and visible wires) shape a harsh environment for walking and PA (Nguyen et al. 2021a; Phan et al., 2020 ).  3.4.1.2 Physical health Urban greenery and street-level elements also play an important role in influencing physical health. One possible reason is that these features are important to PA as aforementioned, which is a major contributor to improving physical health. Studies have found that urban greenness is closely related to decreases in obesity (Keralis et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2021a ), premature mortality (Phan et al., 2020 ), and COVID-19 cases (Nguyen et al., 2020 ). Moreover, neighborhood physical disorder features are associated with increases in obesity, diabetes, and COVID-19 cases. (Keralis et al., 2020 ; Q. Nguyen et al., 2022; Nguyen et al. 2021a; Nguyen et al., 2021b ; X. Xiao et al., 2021 ). Additionally, residents’ perceptions are also found associated with various health outcomes. In particular, a higher sense of community safety, wealth, and liveness are associated with a better prognosis of chronic diseases (Wang et al., 2019c ).  3.4.1.3 Mental health Similar to physical health, greenery and positive perceptions of the neighborhood environment have advantageous effects on mental health as well (He et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2019a, 2020 ; R. Wang et al., 2021b, 2021a; Wu et al., 2021 ). Studies have found that urban greenery is negatively associated with depression (Yoo et al., 2022 ). The greenery improves mental health not only directly through the visual appearance of greenery, but also indirectly by promoting neighborhood cohesion (Chen et al., 2022; Liu et al. 2020c ) and PA (Wang et al., 2019d ). Moreover, perception features are also important to mental health (Larkin et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2019c; Xiang et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2021; Zhang et al. 2021b ). Positive urban perceptions such as safety and beauty may decrease mental stress, while negative urban perceptions may increase the level of mental stress and become a long-term stressor and cause mental disorders (Wang et al., 2019c ).   3.4.2 SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities 3.4.2.1 Affordable and safe housing Urban greenery can also be used for analyzing housing prices and community safety (Bin et al., 2020; Law et al., 2019 ). Urban greening rates and the sky perceptual element are positively correlated with housing prices (Chen et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2019b; Zhang and Dong, 2018 ). One possible pathway is that urban greenness is also positively correlated with the perceived safety of the living environment (Jing et al., 2021 ), which further contributes to higher estate prices (Kang et al., 2021 ). Moreover, daytime volumes and nighttime volumes shape people’s perceptions in opposite ways. The former is related to higher perceived safety, whereas the latter increases the feeling of unsafety (Zhang et al. 2021a ).  3.4.2.2 Transportation SVI has three important contributions to sustainable transportation. First, SVI allows local governments to manage transport infrastructures effectively. SVI can massively detect or locate number of street elements, including sidewalks (Weld et al., 2019 ), utility poles (Zhang et al., 2018 ), telecommunication infrastructure (Hebbalaguppe et al., 2017 ), traffic signages (Campbell et al., 2019 ), and infrastructure defects and degradation (Alipour and Harris, 2020; Chacra and Zelek, 2018 ), which helps to assess and address problems easily. Second, SVI helps transportation authorities to understand regional traffic flow changes. For example, studies have shown that in-depth features extracted from SVI can explain nearly 66.5 % of the change in taxi flows (Zhang et al. 2019a ). Third, SVI provides new possibilities for reducing traffic crashes. Evidence shows that more visible sky, roadway, and signage increased crashes due to visual similarity (Stiles et al., 2022 ).  3.4.2.3 Urban planning Environmental features in SVI (e.g., land uses, street forms, green spaces, and urban aesthetics) can assist urban planning. First, semantic information can improve the accuracy of land use classification (Barleta et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020 ), street types categorization (Alhasoun and González, 2019; Gong et al. 2019b; Zhang et al. 2019b ), and building function recognition (Cao et al., 2018; Hoffmann et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2018 ), and the form of street canyons (F.Y. Gong et al., 2018; Liang et al., 2017; Meng et al. 2020a; Middel et al., 2019; Nice et al., 2020 ). Second, the GVI is the most commonly used street view feature to describe urban green spaces (Barbierato et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2019a ). Studies have suggested that GVI has a relatively weak association with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and hence, GVI could capture urban greenery features different from the satellite data (Larkin and Hystad, 2019; Tong et al., 2020 ). Moreover, SVI could also be used for detecting and classifying urban trees (Wegner et al., 2016 ). Third, SVI can assess urban aesthetic features, such as graffiti (Tokuda et al., 2019 ) and salient buildings (Guan et al., 2020 ), and other higher-level semantic information (e.g., vibrancy) (Wu et al. 2020a ).  3.4.2.4 Urban demographics and socioeconomics SVI-based information is helpful for detailed-level demographic profiling and socioeconomic status estimation. SVI-derived car attributes (e.g., model, make, price) can be used to estimate demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, including unemployment rate, education level, average household income, and voting patterns (Diou et al., 2018; Gebru et al., 2017 ). Moreover, urban greenness captured by SVI can also serve as a proxy for the poverty index as greenery is found negatively associated with the level of urban poverty in Guangzhou, China (Meng et al. 2020b ).  3.4.2.5 Disaster management and air pollution On the one hand, building height and structure typology extracted from SVI can assess the potential disaster risk of buildings for better disaster prediction and management. (Gonzalez et al., 2020; Wang et al. 2021c ). On the other hand, SVI can reflect air quality. For example, Air quality indicators such as NO2 , PM10,  and PM2.5  are negatively associated with street greenery (Wu et al. 2020b ), while NO2  is positively correlated with the vertical distribution of street buildings (Wu et al. 2020b ). Moreover, black carbon has a significant association with street elements such as buildings, roads, cars, and urban greenery (Liu et al. 2020b ).   3.4.3 SDG 13: Climate change The urban heat island effect is the main theme of climate change research, and the environmental information extracted from SVI dataset can contribute to such climate change research. The urban heat island effect is influenced by the street canyon morphology, such as orientation, vertical form, and sky view. Compared with the streets oriented north–south, the streets in the west-east receive higher solar irradiation during summer and lower during winter (Gong et al. 2019a ). The vertical form of the street canyon, such as the tree crown and wall, can reduce land surface temperature, especially in the daytime (Zhang et al. 2019c ). The sky view index of the street canyon is strongly associated with sun duration (Du et al., 2020 ). Moreover, neighborhoods that required heat mitigation can be identified by utilizing sky areas and tree shade in SVI (Sun et al., 2021 ). Local climate zone classification is another critical theme for SDG 13. SVI can provide a micro-level built environment assessment and thus can improve the mapping accuracy for certain types of local climate zones compared with satellite images (Xu et al., 2019 ).  3.4.4 SDG 2: Zero hunger Crop recognition is another research theme related to SDG 2 Zero hunger. With the popularization of SVI and the rapid development of computer vision and pattern recognition technology, it has been used to crop recognition. Automatic identification of pests and crops can provide a better-growing environment for crops and improve the level of agricultural production. By using SVI, the overall accuracy of crop classification reaches 92 % for the Central Valley, 97 % for Illinois, 91 % for South Korea (Yan and Ryu, 2021 ), and 83.3 % for Thailand (Ringland et al., 2019 ).    4 Discussion SVI records environment information based on an eye-level view, which could be an essential supplement to monitor SDGs, given that traditioanl satellite data are from top-down view and have inherent technical issues. This study, for the first time, systematically reviewed the SVI-related studies towards SDGs. We summarized our key findings in Fig. 5  . First, SVI was mainly used for achieving four SDGs, namely sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), good health and well-being (SDG 3), climate change (SDG 13), and zero hunger (SDG 2). Second, the commonly used SVI features included greenery, physical disorder, building layout, and people’s perception. Third, more greenery, less physical disorder, and better neighborhood perceptions were positively related to sustainable cities and communities and better health and well-being. Building layouts were related to the street canyon, contributing to assessing climate change as well as sustainable cities. 4.1 SVI-related SDGs SDG 11 is the most intensively studied goal using SVI. This is not surprising, because SDG 11 concerns a sustainable urban environment, and SVI is a direct reflection of the urban environment. Most SDG 11 targets have been evaluated using SVI. For example, air pollution and greenery extracted from SVI are directly related to improving air quality (Target 11.6) and providing green space (Target 11.7) (Labib et al., 2021; Qi and Hankey, 2021 ). Traffic infrastructure and land use patterns extracted from SVI indirectly help evaluate sustainable transport systems (Target 11.2) and human settlement planning (Target 11.3), respectively (Campbell et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2018 ). However, the reviewed studies paid little attention to protecting cultural and natural heritage (Target 11.4). This target can be easily assessed by identifying the built year of historic buildings and furthermore providing effective means to protect them and improve their safety. SDG 3 is the second most popular goal supported by SVI, which focuses on human health and well-being that are affected by the neighborhood environment. Many studies have suggested that the neighborhood environment (i.e., greenery and walkability) helps to reduce both communicable diseases (Target 3.3) and non-communicable diseases (Target 3.4) (Frank et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2020 ). Moreover, several studies also used SVI to assess SDG 13 and SDG 2. Local blue and green space would shape the local microclimate, which may influence global climate change to some extent (Yang et al., 2020 ). SVI helps identify crop types and pests and thus can provide a better growing environment for crops and improve agricultural production levels (Kagan et al., 2021; Ringland et al., 2019 ). As such SVI data and technologies become more widely used, we believe that more SDGs can be assessed by SVI in the future. For example, the SVI can monitor industrial infrastructure, helping assess SDG 9 (Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation). By monitoring and developing reliable, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure, SVI can further support improving production efficiency (SDG 12) and promoting local economic development (SDG 8). Moreover, by identifying pedestrians’ and drivers’ characteristics (e.g., sex, age, and race), SVI reflects street vitality and citizens’ participation in street lives, which may help reduce inequality (SDG 10). However, this process may invade individual privacy without consent or notification, requiring more discussions before implementation. Although SVI is a useful channel to monitor streetscape objects at a micro level, it may not cover all SDGs. On the one hand, SVI cannot evaluate some SDGs (e.g., life below water (SDG 14)) that are far away from the streets. On the other hand, SVI fails to assess some SDGs (e.g., peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG 16)) that are beyond the micro-level attributes. However, the integration of data from multiple sources (e.g., social media, aerial/satellite imagery, and administrative census) may enable SVI to support more SDGs.  4.2 Key SVI-derived elements and their associations with SDGs Element features, which were commonly used in SDG studies, extracted from SVI based on image classification and semantic segmentation methods improve the accuracy of visual object detection. First, greenery is the most important feature that is positively related to SDGs especially good health (SDG 3) and sustainable settlement (SDG 11). It provides detailed data on the physical aspects of greenery on the street from an eye-level view, such as the vertical distribution of trees and grass, and the distribution of tree shade, which are important to health and well-being and sustainable neighborhoods. Greenery has two pathways to influence health and well-being, which are physical activity and social cohesion. People living in greener areas are more likely to engage in physical activity, bringing beneficial effects on health and well-being (Frank et al., 2019 ). A high-quality green environment also provides a venue for social interaction, which can enhance social capital and improve people’s mental health (Wang et al., 2019c ). Therefore, improving greenery plays an important role in improving health and promoting sustainable cities. Second, physical disorder-related neighborhood features has been found to be negatively related to some SDGs, and hence, monitoring these nuisance features can promote to acheieve SDGs. Studies have shown that exposure to neighborhoods with higher levels of physical disorders (e.g., litter, visible wires, graffiti, and dilapidated buildings) tends to reduce residents’ willingness to walk, leading to increased risks of obesity and other non-communicable diseases (Nguyen et al. 2021a; Phan et al., 2020 ), which hampers the achieving of SDG 3. Luckily, SVI can help pick up these signs of neighborhood deterioration (Mooney et al., 2020 ), promoting earlier interventions in improving neighborhood environments. For example, using the style transfer method to SVI data helps facilitate SDGs 11 and 3. In particular, this method merges the texture information (i.e., style) of one image and the content of another (Gatys et al., 2016 ), which helps to select sustainable and livable environments to be a positive reference and provides guidance for disadvantaged neighborhood reconstruction (Wijnands et al., 2019 ). Third, The building layout is highly related to the street canyon that influences SDG 3, 11, and 16. On the one hand, the vertical distribution of buildings extracted from SVI can affect the daytime land surface temperature (Zhang et al. 2019c ), which is related to the urban heat island effect. On the other hand, the street canyon is associated with the accumulation and diffusion of air pollutants, affecting neighborhood air quality and citizens’ health. The aforementioned element features extracted from SVI paid more attention to objective environmental attributes, but people on streets, the main users of streets, were not received sufficient attention. If the ethics concern will be addressed (e.g., by anonymization) in the future, SVI data can help better achieve SDGs. For example, SVI data can help better capture pedestrian activities on the street, such as to better understand the spatial distribution of jaywalking behavior, and provide the reference for further improvement of urban space (Fan and Loo, 2021 ), which helps reduce deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents (Target 3.6). Besides objective element features, perception features that depicted how people feel about the neighborhood environment also play an important role in affecting SDGs. Active and vital neighborhoods enhance positive human perceptions. Active frontages with windows and doors make people feel safe and lively (Law et al., 2020 ). both well-organized transportation systems and the separation between pedestrians and traffics improve people’s perceived safety (Zhang et al., 2021b ). All of these positive perceptions are beneficial to improving people’s health and well-being and promoting sustainable cities. It is worth noting that the current perception evaluation was mostly from crowdsourcing by volunteers, which may not well represent the actual feelings of local residents. Hence, some follow-ups on field investigation are needed to enhance and verify the accuracy of perceptual feature estimating.  4.3 Future research directions Directions for future research can be drawn based on the limitations of the included studies. First, researchers lack sufficiently time-varying SVI data to examine the causality relationships between the neighborhood environment and SDGs. Most existing studies were observational studies, so they were able to identify correlation relationships but not causality. However, the current frequency of map companies for updating SVI (typically once or twice a year) was insufficient for longitudinal research (e.g., on the basis of the longitudinal, individual-level cohort data). Therefore, building a reliable and open-source global SVI database with a high temporal and spatial resolution is urgent. Second, examining potential mechanisms through which the built environment may affect human perception will be an important area of future research. Human perception of the built environment has been associated with several SDGs, but which street elements are associated with specific perception and how street elements may affect perception need to be further investigated. Third, as two popular remote sensing data sources, SVI and satellite data can be integrated to better represent the built environment. Each of these two types of data has its pros and cons. It is worth exploring how to scientifically integrate these two types of data sources for SDG-related research. Fourth, advanced techniques (e.g., deep learning) are needed to assess the temporal change of SVI. How to minimize potential bias brought by the different camera angles and collection weather is another important task. Fifthly, most of the existing research only focuses on urban areas, while research on rural areas is relatively scarce, which deserves further attention in the future. Finally, it is crucial to create robust indicators to track the overall progress of achieving SDGs. Although the UN established a global indicator framework that includes 232 SDG indicators, the scale, and scope of this framework are daunting even to the most developed countries, and there have not been any established methods and standards for some indicators (CEOS and ESA, 2018 ). So, the global indicator framework was insufficient to determine some crucial associations between the neighborhood environment and SDGs. In our view, SDG-related variables and potential pathways that emerged from this review (Table 3 ) can provide viable alternative means to monitor the achievement of the SDGs and provide a necessary complement to the existing global indicator framework. More importantly, SVI can efficiently support these indicators directly or indirectly.  4.4 Strengths and limitations The study has some major strengths. First, to our knowledge, this is the first review to analyze the roles of SVI on SDGs, which provides a new perspective on measuring, monitoring, and achieving SDGs. Also, our categorization of SDGs variables, SVI-based features and extracted methods can guide scholars to comprehensively quantify SVI-based SDG determinants. Finally, based on the reviewed evidence, this review suggests several actions to employ SVI-based features to assess and achieve SDGs. This review has some limitations. First, not all of the selected articles fall within a single SDG, and some may relate to multiple goals. Thus, we have done our best to assign each included article to the most relevant SDG, which may not be agreed by all. Second, the keyword selection was based on the description of 17 goals, and the list of keywords may not be comprehensive enough, so some articles related to a specific target of a given goal may be missing. Third, inconsistent reporting styles among the included studies, conducted by researchers in various fields, may lead to vague, inaccurate, or missing features in our structured information table, which needs to be improved in the future (Jia et al., 2020 ).   5 Conclusion With limited time to achieve the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, the world needs effective ways to measure global progress towards SDGs. Remote sensing is of great significance to the implementation of the SDGs. Studies have shown that SVI, as a new component of remote sensing data, contributes to the sustainable development of the earth system and human society at different scales in many ways. However, we still lack a systematic and comprehensive understanding of how SVI can contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. The aim of this review is to present the latest SVI-based remote sensing technologies in multidisciplinary studies to better measure and track progress towards the relevant ambitious targets and help identify priority areas for action within the 2030 Agenda. Some of the key benefits of using SVI-based remote sensing for SDG monitoring include having a high spatial resolution, providing eye-level environmental auditing, collecting data at large geographic scales, and providing rich semantic information. With the proliferation of mapping services, this new remote sensing approach can be applied to areas that have previously been overlooked, while the main challenge is to better integrate SVI-derived with other types of information and adapt them at a global scale. By systematically reviewing SVI-related studies of SDGs, this review suggests that SVI is a promising tool to effectively measure, monitor, and achieve SDGs, particularly for SDG 2, 3, 11 and 13. For different purposes of measurement, we need to fully consider different kinds of SVI-based features. The greenery view index has been the most commonly used element feature and related to most SDGs. Perception features based on SVI are also often used to assess SDG 3 and SDG 11. We further recommend investing in human-oriented facilities and infrastructures such as urban grassland, bike lanes and cycling infrastructure, pedestrian facilities, sustainable street canyons, etc., which may reduce the level of physical disorder in neighborhoods, enhance positive environmental perceptions among residents, and increase social connectivity. This will further help us achieve SDGs better and faster. This study suggests that some potential mechanisms between SVI-based features and SDGs need to be further investigated in future studies. This can provide a valuable reference for researchers and governments to effectively use SVI in future SDG research and applications.
