                  Is the younger generation, including millennials and Generation Z, a driving force toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? The younger generation is often described as more socially conscious than the older generation and as promotors of the SDGs; however, little scientific evidence supports these assumptions and expectations. To fill this gap, this study aims to investigate (1) whether the younger cohorts are the pro-SDG generation who drive societies with their sustainable lifestyles to achieve SDGs more actively than the older generations; further, this work elucidates (2) the job-seeking behavior of younger generations. We recently conducted two online surveys in Japan and used different interdisciplinary methodologies. In Study 1, we estimated the marginal generational differences in sustainable lifestyles using a nationwide adult sample (n = 12,098). In Study 2, we elicited the job preferences of university students based on the SDG contributions of companies and expected income using conjoint survey experiment data (n = 668). Together, these findings suggest that the younger generation is likely to be pro-SDGs.

Handling editor. Cecilia Maria Villas Bôas de Almeida Is the younger generation, including millennials and Generation Z, a driving force toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? The younger generation is often described as more socially conscious than the older generation and as promotors of the SDGs; however, little scientific evidence supports these assumptions and expectations. To fill this gap, this study aims to investigate (1) whether the younger cohorts are the pro-SDG generation who drive societies with their sustainable lifestyles to achieve SDGs more actively than the older generations; further, this work elucidates (2) the job-seeking behavior of younger generations. We recently conducted two online surveys in Japan and used different interdisciplinary methodologies. In Study 1, we estimated the marginal generational differences in sustainable lifestyles using a nationwide adult sample (n = 12,098). In Study 2, we elicited the job preferences of university students based on the SDG contributions of companies and expected income using conjoint survey experiment data (n = 668). Together, these findings suggest that the younger generation is likely to be pro-SDGs.   Keywords Millennial  Generation Z  Conjoint survey experiment  Double machine learning  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  Generational differences    1 Introduction Five years have passed since the agreement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aim to achieve 17 goals and 169 targets by 2030. The SDGs urge everyone—public and private sectors and individuals from both developed and developing countries—to change their consumption and production patterns to be more sustainable (United Nations, 2015 ). To advance the SDGs, complex and fundamental transformations of our societal systems are required (Bertelsmann Stiftung and Sustainable Development Solutions Network: SDSN, 2018 ). The world has to change their daily behavior, ultimately shifting human lifestyles (Rauschmayer et al., 2015 ). However, many countries have not taken critical steps in implementing the SDGs (Sachs et al., 2019 ). Today’s younger generation, defined here as the older cohort of Generation Z (18–23) and the younger cohort of millennials (24–30),1  1 Commonly used definitions are people born in 1981–1996 (ages in 2020: 24–39) for millennials, and people born in 1997–2012 (ages in 2020: 7–23) for Generation Z. Considering Yutori education or education with latitude, which may characterize the cohort of the younger generation in Japan, we define the younger generation as born in 1990–2002 (ages in 2020: 18–30). The purpose of this paper is not to compare younger generations; therefore, we do not separate millennials and Generation Z.   is an essential stakeholder in building a sustainable future. In 2030, the younger generation will be the central working force in society and is expected to make real efforts to create a sustainable future and likely play a substantial role in achieving the SDGs. Millennials are generally characterized as socially conscious (Klimkiewicz and Oltra, 2017 ) and supportive of the SDGs (Cheng, 2015 ; Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry, 2019 ). However, these expectations and assumptions are based on non-scientific discussions; little scientific discussion has examined the traits of younger generations regarding the SDGs. This paper, therefore, aims to investigate whether the younger generation really is the pro-SDGs generation that has sustainable lifestyles and pushes society to shift toward the SDGs. Few rigorous empirical studies have examined generational differences in SDG-related decision-making (Deal et al., 2010 ; Lyons and Kuron, 2014 ; Magni and Manzoni, 2020 ). To fill this gap, we examine whether the younger generation lives more sustainable lifestyles—working or living in a place where the SDGs are implemented, creating value through work, and having sustainable consumption behavior—than the older generation. To further understand the decision-making of the young generation regarding SDG implementation, we investigate the job-seeking preferences of younger people toward companies that contribute to the SDGs. Because tackling sustainability challenges requires an interdisciplinary approach (Brown et al., 2019 ; Chabay, 2020 ; Saito et al., 2017 ), we did not develop this paper based on a single discipline, but based it on different disciplines, including management and economics. To offer novel insights into challenges that require urgent attention, we combined different methodologies. We conducted two online surveys in Japan, where the rapid implementation of the SDGs into society has occurred. Study 1 targeted all adult generations, which allowed us to investigate generational differences among the younger and older cohorts. Marginal generational differences toward a sustainable lifestyle were estimated using a machine learning technique initially developed in the field of statistical sciences, which is increasingly being applied to other fields, including economics (Athey and Imbens, 2019 ) and epidemiology (Wiemken and Kelley, 2019 ), to study causal inferences. Study 2 aimed to elicit the job preferences of university students based on company contributions toward the SDGs and expected income using a conjoint survey experiment. Since its introduction by Hainmueller et al. (2014) , researchers have increasingly added methodological advancement to conjoint surveys to study topics such as voting behavior and demands for public policies in political science (Bansak et al., 2020 ; Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer, 2019 ). We embedded an information treatment experiment in the conjoint survey to further investigate if the support of younger people for companies contributing to the SDGs expands or shrinks as they become more informed. The current study prioritizes drawing practical implications rather than focusing on providing theoretical ones. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2  reviews the literature on younger generations, discusses the conceptual framework, and states the hypotheses. Section 3  introduces the methodology, including data collection and survey design, and presents the calculations and results. Section 4  discusses the results, including the potential implications for both businesses and policymakers, and whether the younger generation is a pro-SDG generation based on our experimental results.  2 Concept framework and hypotheses Although few studies have been conducted on the implementation of the SDGs in younger generations, a growing number of studies have explored the sustainable lifestyles of younger generations, especially millennials. In those studies, researchers investigated the lifestyle of younger generations mostly from marketing and organizational perspectives. A limited number of studies have estimated generational differences after controlling for age (effect of being mature) and period (effects of events at any particular point in time) effects using advanced estimation strategies (Parry and Urwin, 2011 ). Mannheim (1952)  originally provided a theoretical background on generational differences, which was later developed by his followers (Parry and Urwin, 2011 ). The theory of generations suggests that studying generations—a group of people born in the same period who share societal events and cultural symbols—can elucidate social structures. Today’s young generation in Japan has shared the same events that may influence them to form pro-SDG attitudes. They are defined by education reform in Japan—the younger generation underwent Yutori education, a Japanese education policy that reduced classroom hours in school education to provide room for other activities (Hiam et al., 2018 ). They also experienced social norm changes following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and the ongoing Fukushima nuclear crisis. Drawing on the theory of generations, we developed a conceptual framework and formulated the research hypotheses. 2.1 Younger generation and sustainable lifestyles A growing number of empirical studies have offered features of younger generations regarding sustainable lifestyles in various areas, including sustainable consumption, pro-environmental behavior, and work value. Concerning sustainable consumption, a recent literature review on generational differences toward organic food purchase decisions has shown that although all generations have favorable attitudes toward organic food, Generation Z has the lowest purchasing behavior (Kamenidou et al., 2020 ). Regarding pro-environmental behavior, previous studies have shown mixed results regarding generational differences. A study in the United States has shown that environmental value and political orientation are better predictors of environmental concerns than generation (Gray et al., 2019 ). In contrast, another study in the United States has shown that millennials are more environmentally conscious, and their greater tendencies toward pro-environmentalism would not change even if they were older (Etezady et al., 2020 ). Lee et al. (2020)  showed that experiencing ride-sharing reinforces the pro-sustainable behavior of millennials. Promoting alternative means of transportation during travel may increase the pro-sustainable behavior of millennials. To provide insights into managing young workers, researchers have conducted studies on work value. A study by Waples and Brachle (2020)  showed that corporate social responsibility (CSR) is seen positively by young job-seekers, and information regarding pay levels does not mediate the impact of CSR on attractiveness. Despite studies showing that millennials are socially conscious, the millennial generation is often described as the “me generation” because they are more individualistic and self-centered (Allen et al., 2015 ; Twenge et al., 2010 ). Alonso-Almeida and Llach (2019)  reported that regardless of millennials being individualistic, they are more attracted to sustainable companies according to a cross-country analysis of six libero-American countries. Furthermore, Hirota (2015)  showed that contemporary workers expect to gain something other than money from working. Magni and Manzoni (2020)  have shown that millennials and older generations have similar expectations toward the workplace, but the degree of their expectation is different. For instance, job security is one of the essential elements for both generations, but millennials have significantly higher expectations. Allen et al. (2015)  found that millennials exhibit higher entitlement than older generations. Their study suggested that the unscientific assumption that the millennial generation is the “me generation” is accurate. Research on seasonal workers showed that millennials have lower organizational commitment than Generation X (in their 40s) (Glazer et al., 2019 ). Twenge et al. (2010)  used time-series data for 30 years and analyzed generational differences in work values. They found that millennials have few intrinsic work values, including helping others and contributing to society, than do older generations. Although studies have investigated millennials’ attitudes toward the workplace, studies on Generation Z are rare (Magni and Manzoni, 2020 ; Schroth, 2019 ).  2.2 Generational differences between younger and older generations Generational effects, especially focusing on millennials in the workplace, have been a popular research focus (Lyons and Kuron, 2014 ). However, many of these studies were drawn from targeted cohort samples or used simple differences in mean. A limited number of studies provide evidence of generational differences; it is important that they are distinguished. Deal et al. (2010)  reviewed research on millennials at work and found no notable generational differences. A meta-analysis of generational differences in work-related attitudes demonstrated that no notable generational differences exist (Costanza et al., 2012 ). Scholars have suggested that being young does not necessarily relate to the fact that a particular generation has specific traits; to investigate generational effects, it is necessary to conduct longitudinal studies (Campbell et al., 2015 ; Deal et al., 2010 ) or well-constructed cross-sectional studies (Lyons and Kuron, 2014 ). Recent studies have used cross-temporal or panel datasets to estimate the pure generational effects after eliminating age and period effects (Kalleberg and Marsden, 2019 ). We agree that panel data can meet the statistical requirement to control other effects; however, developing sufficient datasets takes many years, and researchers who attempt to investigate emerging issues may need to rely on a cross-sectional dataset. Some researchers have used econometric techniques, which allow them to control for age effects and to estimate generational differences using cross-sectional datasets (e.g., Etezady et al., 2020 ; Zuo and Lai, 2020 ). In this study, we used a cross-sectional dataset and employed lasso regression to control for other effects that may affect the outcome variables (for details, see section 3.1.2 ). Using this method, we attempted to estimate marginal generational differences in SDG-related lifestyles. In this study, we define sustainable lifestyles as attitudes and behaviors that may transform our society toward reaching the SDGs, including higher expectations of active societal involvement in SDG implementation, higher intrinsic work value, lower extrinsic work value, and higher pro-sustainable behavior. Based on the above, we developed the following hypotheses:H1 The younger generation has higher expectations toward society regarding the implementation of the SDGs than the older generations.  H2a The younger generation prefers intrinsic work values such as ikigai (reason for being) and social contribution more than the older generations.  H2b The younger generation prefers extrinsic work values, such as good pay and job security less than the older generations.  H3 The younger generation has higher pro-sustainable behavior than the older generations.    2.3 The complexity of implementing the SDGs Achieving the SDGs requires a deeper understanding of the trade-offs among the goals (Pradhan, 2019 ). It is important for policymakers to understand the individual elements of sustainable lifestyles that may contribute to the implementation of the SDGs. Individual goals and targets may conflict with each other although they are all aiming for sustainable development (Barbier and Burgess, 2019 ; International Council for Science, 2017 ; Mainali et al., 2018 ). Although the SDGs are implemented in many countries, only some goals have attracted scholarly attention, and others have not yet been studied (Salvia et al., 2019 ). In line with Japanese government initiatives, the business, local government, and education sectors in Japan have incorporated the SDGs into their activities (i.e., Ueno et al., 2018 , 2017 ). Although nearly 60% of Japanese companies claimed to have embedded the SDGs into their middle- and long-term corporate strategies in 2019 (The Nikkei, 2019 ), our survey results have shown that awareness of the SDGs is still slowly increasing at the individual level. Only 6.702% of the Japanese adults surveyed in 2019 and 20.55% in 2020 were highly familiar with the SDGs. In the real world, people make decisions in a multidimensional choice setting (Hainmueller et al., 2014 ); the decisions of younger people to advance toward the SDGs may be made based on different choices. To investigate whether the younger generation is a pro-SDG generation, we further examine how young people decide in a multidimensional choice setting. In particular, we use the case of job preferences, where younger people have to decide based on multiple attributes regarding company contributions toward the SDGs and expected income. Based on the above literature and discussion, we propose the following hypotheses:H4 Younger people prefer to work for companies that contribute to the SDGs.  H5 Raising awareness of the SDGs influences young people’s willingness to dispense income to contribute to the SDGs.     3 Empirical analyses To test the five hypotheses presented in Section 2 , we used two online surveys conducted in Japan. Study 1 draws on the entire adult population, which allows us to compare different generational preferences for sustainable lifestyles. Study 2 looks at a sample of university students consisting of only the younger generation; this latter sample offers the first insights into university student’ preferences for companies contributing to the SDGs and the effects of information treatment. The methods and results of the two studies are presented below. 3.1 Study 1 We conducted a nationwide online survey targeting Japanese adults aged 18–75 in March 2019 and 2020. Through Rakuten Insight, Inc., a research company in Japan with access to 2.2 million panelists, a sample of respondents was collected. To ensure that the final data matched the population distribution, we used age, gender, and regional residential quotas. We used repeated cross-sectional data of 6043 in 2019 and 6055 in 2020, yielding 12,098 samples. Using subjective measures collected through the survey, we aimed to investigate whether the younger generation is a pro-SDG generation. 3.1.1 Dependent variables As discussed in Section 1 , to achieve greater sustainability, the way we live has to change fundamentally. To measure respondent’ lifestyle sustainability, we used 13 different dependent variables, including expectations of society’s efforts to contribute to the SDGs, work value, and pro-sustainable behavior. The dependent variables were constructed using subjective questions related to these measures. Table 1   presents a list of the dependent variables used in this analysis, along with descriptive statistics.  3.1.2 Independent variables Our variable of interest is a dummy variable, the younger generation aged 18–30 in 2020, which takes a value of 1 if a respondent is born in 1990–2002 and 0 otherwise. As discussed in Section 2.2 , estimating differences in a generational cohort is challenging, because estimating generational differences requires differentiating the age and period effects from the generational effects. We included control variables in our models to eliminate such effects. Researchers usually identify potential controls based on theory or intuition; however, determining the right control variables to be included in a model is challenging (Belloni et al., 2017 ). Because we have a rich dataset on potential control variables, we utilized a data-driven method to select variables to control for other factors. In particular, we utilized cross-fit partialing-out lasso (double machine learning) regressions. As previous research has shown that individual characteristics, life events, and other factors affect sustainable lifestyles, we treat them as potential control variables. Along with the measures presented in Section 3.1.1 , we collected a large number of heterogeneous characteristics for respondents, and, depending on the model, used 139–143 control variables in our analyses. A list of potential control variables is presented in the Supplementary Materials.  3.1.3 Estimation strategy To estimate the marginal effects of the younger generation on a sustainable lifestyle, we used the cross-fit partialing-out lasso regressions developed by Chernozhukov et al. (2018) . As presented in Table 1 , we have 13 different measures, including continuous and binary dependent variables. Thus, we used two estimation models. The estimation model for linear regression is as follows:(1) E [ y |  d , x  ]  = d α ′  + x β ′  ,     where y   is a continuous variable for work value, pro-globalization behavior, or pro-environmental behavior; d   is a variable of interest for the younger generation; x   is a set of potential control variables that the lasso selects; α   is the corresponding coefficient to be estimated; and β   is the coefficient of the control variables, which is not reported in the analysis. The estimation model for the logistic regression is as follows:(2) Pr ( y = 1 | d , x  )  = exp ( d α ′  + x β ′   )   1 + exp ( d α ′  + x β ′   )    ,     where y   is a dummy variable for expectations of the society regarding SDG implementation or pro-sustainable consumption, which takes the value of 1 if the person agrees with the measure and 0 otherwise; d   is a variable of interest for the younger generation; x   represents the potential control variables that the lasso selects; α   is the corresponding coefficient to be estimated; and β   is the coefficient of the control variables, which is not reported in the analysis.  3.1.4 Results To test H1 , H2 , and H3 , we estimated 13 different models using the above regression analyses. Fig. 1   presents the estimated marginal effect of the younger generation on sustainable lifestyles. The estimators indicate the probability of the younger generation choosing a specific measure referencing the older generation aged 31–75. A1 in the Appendix presents the full regression analysis results, statistical test results, and number of control variables used. First, to understand the general sustainable lifestyles across generations, we reviewed the descriptive statistics presented in Table 1 . The older generation also expected society to be actively involved in SDG implementation although the younger generation showed a higher percentage. For example, 52.6% of the younger generation and 49.4% of the older hoped that the municipality they are currently living in is actively involved in working toward the SDGs (see a-1). Concerning pro-sustainable consumption behavior, 34.0% of the younger generation and 29.2% of the older claimed that they purchase a sustainable product or service even if it is more expensive (see c-3). Moreover, 21.8% of the younger generation and 12.5% of the older claimed that they care about the contribution of a corporation toward the SDGs when choosing their product or service (see c-5). These results indicate that although the expectations of society are higher, pro-sustainable behavior remains low across generations. For work value, making money was scored the highest for both generations among the four measures used in this study (see b-2). The younger generation have a statistically significant positive effect on expectations toward society (work, school, and the community that respondents live in) regarding implementation of the SDGs. Being younger increased the expectation of the municipality of residence to be actively involved in the SDGs by 27.9%, and those of the school or workplace by 23.8% (see a-1 and a-2 of Fig. 1 ). In terms of future perspectives, the younger generation was more willing to live in a municipality or work for a company actively involved in implementing the SDGs. Being younger increased the expectation of the future municipality of residence by 30.8%, and those to the future school or workplace by 18.3% (see a-3 and a-4). H1 , stating that expectations of the society regarding implementation of the SDGs are higher for the younger generation than the older, is thus supported. We used four measures to test the work value of the younger generation. Two measures of intrinsic work value, such as reason for being and social contribution, were positive, but the parameter for social contribution was not statistically significant, indicating that being younger had no statistically significant effect. H2a is partially supported. However, two parameters for intrinsic work value, good pay and job security, were positive and statistically significant, indicating that the younger generation preferred extrinsic work value more than the older generation (see b-2 to b-3). H2b  is not supported. We used five measures to test if the younger generation’s sustainable behavior of the younger generation was higher than that of the older generation. Three parameters for pro-globalization behavior, willingness to pay a premium for sustainable goods, and corporate contributions toward the SDGs when choosing a service or product were positive and statistically significant, indicating that the younger generation was more likely to engage in pro-globalization activities, to pay higher prices for sustainable products, and to care about corporate contributions toward the SDGs than the older generation (see c-1, c-3, and c-5). However, a parameter for pro-environmental behavior was negative and statistically significant, indicating that the younger generation is less likely to engage in pro-environmental behavior than the older generations. Thus, H3 , stating that the younger generation shows higher pro-sustainable behavior than the older generation, is partially supported. In summary, Study 1 revealed that the younger generation has relatively higher expectations of society for SDG implementation and willingness to pay a premium for sustainable goods/services than the older generation. However, the results on pro-environmental behavior and intrinsic work value demonstrated that younger people do not always live more sustainably than the older generation. To further investigate the preferences of younger people, especially regarding implementation of the SDGs in multidimensional choice settings, we conducted a study targeting university students, who make up part of our target generations.   3.2 Study 2 We conducted an online survey targeting university students in February and March 2020. We recruited respondents at Hiroshima University, a comprehensive research university comprising a total of 14,875 undergraduate and graduate students with the standard age of enrollment being 19–27. To ensure that the final data represent the diversity of the student body, we used the student information system of the entire university and collected completed samples from 668 university students. To effectively recruit participants, we provided small incentives and allowed them to enter a prize draw to win a gift card ranging from 500 to 5000 yen upon completion of the survey. Data collection for this experiment was conducted in combination with the Hiroshima University Awareness Survey 2020 (Yamane, 2020 ).2  2 Note that Yamane (2020)  presents the distribution of the respondents and their perceptions of SDG implementation. A total of 700 respondents including 668 students and 32 alumni were classified as students in the report.   3.2.1 Experiment design To investigate the job preferences of the younger generation for companies depending on their SDG contributions and offered salary, we employed a conjoint survey experiment. Table 2   presents the conjoint design, including the attributes and information treatment. The English translation of the scenario is provided in Appendix A2 . For attributes regarding the SDGs, we carefully selected six out of the 17 goals, because using all of them would have increased the fatigue effect. Direct economic returns from SDG-related activities refer only to profits directly attributable to these activities rather than total company profits. The expected annual income at the age of 30 was used to measure the effects of monetary value. Furthermore, we tested how the preferences of the younger generation were affected by information on the SDGs. We employed a randomized control trial (RCT), and respondents were randomly exposed to three different sets of information on the SDGs, as follows:T1 The SDGs should be mainstreamed in the business, and it must be profitable to realizing a sustainable society must be profitable;  T2 Definition of SDG-washing; and  T3 Information on the achievements of the SDGs.    The English translation of the information treatments given to the respondents is provided in Appendix A3 . To confirm their understanding of the content after each was provided, they were given quizzes of up to two questions. Information was provided for a second time if the respondent failed the quiz, but the quizzes were not repeated. In the RCT design, the participants were divided into eight groups. Appendix A4  presents the structural flow of the survey design. After the information treatment was given or not based on the assigned groups, respondents were instructed to read the scenario and then rank three choices displayed on their screens in order of preference, imagining that they were seeking a job. The participants performed this task six times. The three choices were to select either of the hypothetical companies or to choose neither of them.  3.2.2 Estimation strategy We estimated the causal effects of the choices of the younger generation using the method proposed by Hainmueller et al. (2014) . The average marginal component effect (AMCE) represented the average causal effect of an attribute on the likelihood that a given company is chosen relative to a baseline level. The estimation model is as follows:(3) y i t j   = β 0  + ∑ l = 1  8  ∑ d = 2  D l   β l d   x i t j l d   + u i t j   ,    where y i t j   ∈ { 0,1 }     is a binary choice indicator variable for company j   in the task t   of respondent i ,   x i t j l d      is a dummy variable for the d  -th level of attribute l  , D l     is the number of levels of attribute l  , β l d      is the corresponding coefficient to be estimated, β 0    is a constant term, and u i t j      denotes the error term. We used ordinary least squares regressions, as presented by Hainmueller et al. (2014) . We regressed the binary choice variable on dummy variables for each attribute level, excluding the baseline levels, no SDG contributions, no profit, and the lowest expected income. The outcome variable takes the value of 1 if the preference rank of a company is higher than that of its alternative company, and 0 otherwise. In addition to the AMCE, following the estimation adopted by Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer (2019) , the probabilities of overall support for the chosen company were estimated. Here, the outcome variable takes the value of 1 if the preference rank of a company is higher than both the status quo (choose neither of the companies) and an alternative company, and 0 otherwise. Using the interaction terms in the logistic regression, we predicted the support for all possible combinations. In particular, we calculated the effect of information treatment on support for companies as indicated below:a) the most SDG-minded company with the highest income;  b) the most SDG-minded company with the lowest income; and  c) the least SDG-minded company with the highest income.    The purpose of this approach is to examine whether awareness about the SDGs influences young people’s willingness to dispense with the financial benefits resulting from work in favor of working for a more SDG-minded company.  3.2.3 Results To test H4 , we estimated the AMCE using the regression analyses above. Fig. 2   presents the estimated AMCE. Table A5  in the Appendix presents the full regression analysis and statistical test results. All estimated coefficients were statistically significant at the 1% level. Contributing to any goal and profiting through SDG contribution had a statistically significant positive effect on job-seeking for young people. This was consistent with and supports our earlier work targeting all Japanese adult generations (Yamane and Kaneko, 2021 ). H4 , which states that the younger generation prefers to work for companies contributing to the SDGs, is thus supported. However, the expected income of 6 million yen had the most significant treatment effects in support for a company, indicating that offering a higher income will increase the demand for a company even if it does not contribute to the SDGs. To test H5 , we estimated the effect of information treatment on support for different SDG-minded companies. The estimated overall support is shown in Fig. 3  , and the definitions of the SDG-minded companies are shown in Table 2 . Not surprisingly, the most popular combination of the attributes among respondents was the most SDG-minded company with the highest income, which had a support of 0.871. In contrast, support for the most SDG-minded company with the lowest income was low at 0.562; support for the least SDG-minded company with the highest income was even lower at 0.281. Awareness of the SDGs affected the perception of young people’s job-seeking decisions. Support for the most SDG-minded company with the lowest income increased when the information was provided to the respondents (Fig. 3 -b). Their support were higher in the information treatment groups than in the control group. We expected that giving negative information regarding implementation of the SDGs by a company (T2) would result in a negative impression of respondents and lower their support, but the negative information also caused positive effects, which requires further investigation. Similarly, support of the least SDG-minded company with the highest income generally decreased when the information was provided to respondents (Fig. 3 -c). This may indicate that awareness about the SDGs influences young people’s willingness to dispense with income in favor of working for a more SDG-minded company. H5  is thus supported. In the following section, the results from the two studies will be discussed regarding implications for promoting the SDGs.    4 Discussion and conclusions The younger generation is widely thought to be more progressive about promoting sustainability and having a pro-SDG lifestyle; however, academic studies that looked into generational differences found contradictory results, and in most of which did not show generational differences (Deal et al., 2010 ). Therefore, we examined whether the younger generation is a driving force for endorsing the SDGs by examining generational differences in lifestyle and the job preferences of younger people. Here, we highlight two main findings, along with their implications for businesses, academics, and policymakers. First, the younger generation had relatively higher pro-sustainable attitudes or perceptions than did the older generation; however, for intrinsic work value and pro-environmental behavior, the younger generation was not more pro-sustainable than the older generation. Second, raising awareness about the SDGs influences young people’s willingness to accept a lower income in favor of working for a more SDG-minded company. 4.1 Main findings The first main finding of this study was that younger people live more sustainable lifestyles than older ones. Nearly half of the respondents, including both generations, claimed that they wished to live in a municipality actively implementing the SDGs. However, when it comes to pro-sustainable behavior, it decreased to 30.1% of the total respondents who claimed that they pay a premium for sustainable goods and 14.2% of the total respondents who claimed that they care about corporate contributions to the SDGs when choosing their product or service. Our results from the lasso regressions showed that after controlling for other factors, being the younger generation increased these sustainable lifestyles with reference to the older generations. These results suggest that the younger generation has attitudes and behaviors that change society to be more sustainable. However, in some measures, the results did not show that the younger generation is more pro-sustainable than the older generation. Unlike the study by Etezady et al. (2020) , which found that millennials were more environmentally conscious in the U.S., our results showed that the younger generation might not contribute to pro-environmental behavior as much as the older generation. Furthermore, generational differences were found in extrinsic work values. The younger generation is looking for better pay and job security than the older generation. This is consistent with Guillot-Soulez and Soulez (2014) , who found that younger generations prefer job security. Although previous research has shown that millennials in the U.S. had less intrinsic work value (Twenge et al., 2010 ), no generational differences were found in intrinsic work value, particularly social contribution. The second main finding comes from Study 2, which tested whether raising SDG awareness would lead to changes in preferences toward supporting an SDG-minded company when selecting a company to work for, indicating that awareness about the SDGs may influence young people’s willingness to dispense with income in favor of working for a more SDG-minded company. Waples and Brachle (2020)  showed that pay does not overpower the influence of CSR activity, and our findings are somewhat consistent with theirs. The findings suggest that younger generations could change their behavior when they become knowledgeable about the inherent nature of the SDGs, despite the findings from Study 1 showing that the younger generations preferred good pay more than the older generation.  4.2 Implications These findings have practical implications. The primary aim of the current study was to explore the extent to which the younger generation lives sustainable lifestyles and supports the SDGs, the results are informative. Our findings suggest that today’s younger generation can be the driving force for achieving the SDGs. When university students were selecting a company to work for, the probability of selecting the least SDG-minded company was as low as 0.281, even if it offered a high salary. The probability of selecting the most SDG-minded company increased to 0.562 with the lowest salary and 0.871 with the highest salary. These findings are consistent with those of Alonso-Almeida and Llach (2019) , who suggested that millennials are attracted to sustainable companies, and Hirota (2015) , who stated that people today are looking for something other than money from work. The younger generations already have a somewhat higher pro-sustainable lifestyle than the older generations, and raising awareness would increase sufficient support for SDG implementation even further. The younger generation can push society forward to increasing lifestyle sustainability. Furthermore, the traditional business model, oriented toward short-term economic value, needs to be revisited (Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). The way businesses operate requires significant transformation to meet sustainability challenges (Bocken et al., 2015 ) and to achieve the SDGs (Ohno et al., 2019 ). These results provide evidence for businesses to consider making such change. Knowing the preferences of the younger generation, businesses need to contribute to the SDGs, because potential employees place a value on sustainability. Employee expectations would increase even more as awareness of the SDGs increases. Policymakers can use this evidence to promote SDG implementation. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether today’s younger generation represents pro-SDG generations, using interdisciplinary approaches because sustainability challenges are interconnected and require urgent attention. While drawing on the theory of generations, we built our research on studies from different disciplines and applied methods commonly used in different disciplines. This study contributes to elucidating the theory of generations and sustainable lifestyles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate generational differences in the context of SDG implementation. The methodology used to investigate generational differences in this study enriches previous studies because it controls for age and period effects using a cross-sectional dataset.  4.3 Limitations and future studies Some limitations of our study must be acknowledged, which in turn point to further research opportunities. Despite its limitations, this study’s findings certainly elucidate the pro-sustainable lifestyle of the younger generation; however, our study relied on a maximum of two years of observations. Thus, we were unable to show long-term perspectives. Furthermore, our studies were conducted in Japan. Therefore, observing long-term behavioral changes and collecting evidence from other countries may provide further insights into this topic in the future.
