                  Background
                  The United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 3.1 aims to reduce maternal mortality worldwide to 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030, which requires greater skilled birth attendant (SBA) coverage and increased health awareness. By evaluating relevant sociodemographic factors, this study aimed to identify different groups of women who lack health awareness and access to SBA services in eight selected low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) of South and South-East Asia (SSEA), namely, Afghanistan, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, and Timor-Leste.
               
                  Methods
                  Nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) on women aged 15–49 years were analysed with a pooled sample of 95,521. Complex survey-adjusted logistic regression models were fitted to assess sociodemographic factors, SBA coverage, and health awareness.
               
                  Results
                  Women with higher health awareness were 44.4% (95% CI:1.32–1.58, p<0.001) more likely to access SBAs compared to the rest. Women and/or their partners with no or primary-level education, who were poorer, became young mothers (≤20 years), not involved in decision-making, or hardly exposed to media were less likely to seek SBAs and have higher health awareness. Women in rural areas with more children were also less likely to use SBAs. Timor-Leste, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Nepal underperformed on SBA coverage amongst the selected LMICs of the SSEA region.
               
                  Conclusion
                  Health education and mass-media-driven awareness could be an interventional avenue for LMICs to increase SBA coverage. Future studies comparing health policies within the SSEA region are required to identify reasons behind some nations’ underperformance, while others are on track to achieve SDG 3.1.

Background The United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 3.1 aims to reduce maternal mortality worldwide to 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030, which requires greater skilled birth attendant (SBA) coverage and increased health awareness. By evaluating relevant sociodemographic factors, this study aimed to identify different groups of women who lack health awareness and access to SBA services in eight selected low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) of South and South-East Asia (SSEA), namely, Afghanistan, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, and Timor-Leste.  Methods Nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) on women aged 15–49 years were analysed with a pooled sample of 95,521. Complex survey-adjusted logistic regression models were fitted to assess sociodemographic factors, SBA coverage, and health awareness.  Results Women with higher health awareness were 44.4% (95% CI:1.32–1.58, p <0.001) more likely to access SBAs compared to the rest. Women and/or their partners with no or primary-level education, who were poorer, became young mothers (≤20 years), not involved in decision-making, or hardly exposed to media were less likely to seek SBAs and have higher health awareness. Women in rural areas with more children were also less likely to use SBAs. Timor-Leste, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Nepal underperformed on SBA coverage amongst the selected LMICs of the SSEA region.  Conclusion Health education and mass-media-driven awareness could be an interventional avenue for LMICs to increase SBA coverage. Future studies comparing health policies within the SSEA region are required to identify reasons behind some nations’ underperformance, while others are on track to achieve SDG 3.1.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Maternal mortality ratio  Skilled birth attendants  Health awareness  Demographic and health surveys    Introduction Reducing the maternal mortality rate (MMR) in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) worldwide remains a challenge for meeting global public-health related sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030. One of the United Nation's (UN) 2030 goals, SDG 3.1, is to “reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births” (UN, 2015 , p. 18). Despite ground-breaking improvements as part of the Millennium Development Goals, 2017 data found that approximately 810 women die daily from preventable pregnancy- and childbirth-related causes (The World Health Organisation (WHO), 2019 ), which necessitates early detection and intervention for disadvantaged women. One key indicator proposed by the UN for targeting the MMR is the proportion of births attended by skilled birth attendants (SBAs) (UN, 2015 ). WHO (2004 ) defines “skilled birth attendant” as a qualified medical professional (such as a doctor, nurse, or midwife) who is trained to have the skills needed to manage normal and complicated pregnancies, childbirth, and postnatal concerns. Increasing SBA coverage, along with improving women's education, is expected to substantially reduce maternal deaths (UN et al., 2017 ). MMRs in some countries of the Asia-Pacific region are persistently high (UN et al., 2017 ).The current study focused on eight LMICs across the South and South-East Asia (SSEA) region, namely Afghanistan, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, and Timor-Leste. Between 2000 and 2017, the South Asia sub-region reduced its MMR by 59% (WHO, 2019 ). However, in 2017, South Asia still accounted for 20% of global maternal deaths, at a rate of 157 per 100,000 live births (WHO, 2019 ). Identifying those who lack SBA coverage could improve the MMR in the SSEA region. Numerous studies have explored sociodemographic factors that are associated with SBA coverage. One of the key sociodemographic factors for health-service access is women's level of education. In a review of Afghanistan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, high rates of poor health for mothers and children were found to be underpinned by a range of sociodemographic factors, including women's illiteracy (Bhutta et al., 2004 ). In rural Myanmar, higher-level education in both women and their partners was associated with greater SBA-service use (Oo et al., 2012 ). These studies confirm that women's education is pivotal for SBA coverage in the SSEA region. Progress towards universal SBA coverage was observed to be slower for women in poorer households (UNICEF, 2018 ). Financially disadvantaged women in Afghanistan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka were observed to face difficulties in accessing health services (Bhutta et al., 2004 ). Rich women were observed as being disproportionately higher users of SBA-assisted deliveries compared to poorer women, irrespective of other maternal characteristics (Myint et al., 2018 ). These studies confirm that household wealth is another sociodemographic factor associated with SBA coverage for LMICs in the SSEA region. Progress towards universal SBA coverage is slower in rural areas (WHO, 2007b ; UNICEF, 2018 ). Significant inequalities in SBA coverage are found between Nepal's urban and rural areas, with these inequalities associated with Nepal having the lowest SBA coverage within the wider region (Metcalfe and Adegoke, 2013 ). Remoteness of residence is thus shown to be another important sociodemographic factor that is associated with SBA coverage for LMICs in the SSEA region. Women's social status is often devalued in patriarchal societies, which can hinder their access to health services including SBAs. For example, women in India are observed to face substantial discrimination on access to healthcare (Kapoor et al., 2019 ), which may stem from women traditionally being considered second-class citizens and restricted from social, financial, physical, and/or psychological decision-making (Agewell Foundation, 2015 ). In selected low-income countries, including Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines, the most empowered women were found to be more likely to access SBA services compared to minimally empowered women (Ahmed et al., 2010 ). Social inequity, thus considered, is a predictor of SBA coverage for LMICs in the SSEA region. Aside from sociodemographic factors, evidence from past studies suggests that individuals’ health awareness is a key determinant for accessing health services such as SBAs, where health awareness is conceptualised as having knowledge and understanding about a health service and applying these where necessary (Saurman, 2016 ). Higher health awareness is associated with greater participation in activities designed to improve health or diagnose diseases (WHO, 2013 ). In a Nepalese district, women who received a community-based health-awareness intervention on birth outcomes were approximately three times more likely to use SBAs than control-group participants (Manandhar et al., 2004 ). In another study which explained the value of SBAs to partners, men's knowledge, determining SBA coverage, and joint decision-making about delivery care were higher in the intervention group compared to the control group (Nasreen et al., 2012 ). These studies stress the importance of both men and women's health awareness for SBA coverage. Studies have also explored the complex inter-relationships amongst sociodemographic factors, health awareness, and SBA coverage. For example, Ezechi and Odberg‐Petterson (2012 ) recommend that low-income countries should use basic education to improve health-workers’ health knowledge for greater pregnancy and delivery care, whereas Bhowmik et al. (2020 ) argue that primary education alone is not enough to significantly change SBA coverage. Other factors, such as gender inequality, can weaken the association between health awareness and SBA coverage (McPherson et al., 2006 ). There remains a research gap on sociodemographic factors related to health awareness, and how these factors influence access to SBA services for women in LMICs, particularly in the SSEA region. The aim of the study is to assess sociodemographic factors associated with health awareness and SBA coverage, ultimately to identify these women in the above-mentioned eight LMICs in the SSEA region.  Methods Study design Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) are cross-sectional, standardised, and nationally representative surveys carried out in over 90 countries (Short Fabic, et al., 2012 ). The survey methodology is consistent across DHSs and the variables are homogenous, which allows cross-evaluation of multi-country surveys (Bhowmik et al., 2020 ). Each DHS uses two-stage stratified cluster sampling. Enumeration areas (EAs) from census data are the primary sampling units (PSUs). In stage one, a stratified sample of EAs (the clusters) are selected using the probability-proportional-to-size method. In stage two, a pre-determined number of households are selected from EAs using an equal-probability systematic-sampling method. A household questionnaire is then administered in each household. Each eligible woman aged 15 to 49 years from a household is then interviewed with an individual survey (UN, 2005 ). A formally appointed review board reviews and approves the DHSs for use. Fieldworkers obtain consent from the human participants before they administer the survey. The current study used the latest-released surveys available for eight selected LMICs in the SSEA region including Afghanistan (2015), India (2015–16), Indonesia (2017), Myanmar (2015–16), Nepal (2016), Pakistan (2017–18), Philippines (2017), and Timor-Leste (2016). While 11 countries were initially considered for inclusion in this study, the Bangladesh DHS was excluded from analysis owing to missing data on the three variables used to measure the health awareness outcome variable, and the Vietnam DHS was excluded as it was missing data on a range of sociodemographic variables. The Cambodia dataset was excluded from analysis as one of the two health-awareness outcome variable categories was represented by less than 5% of the sample. This study included country as a nominal explanatory variable for adjusting country-wise variance.  Participants and samples The study used data for women aged 15 to 49 years from DHSs conducted in the selected LMICs in the SSEA region. In the Pakistan dataset, 2704 of the 15,068 cases had sampling weights of zero. Such weights were assigned by the DHS data administrators to cases when the woman was under 15 years of age. As this fell outside of the age-range of interest, cases with zero weights were omitted from the dataset. In the cleaned datasets, the total sample sizes were: Afghanistan (n  = 19,071), India (n  = 32,781), Indonesia(n  = 14,757), Myanmar (n  = 3617), Nepal (n  = 3965), Pakistan (n  = 6687), Philippines (n  = 7394), and Timor-Leste (n  = 1689). In the cleaned pooled dataset, the total sample size was n  = 95,521.  Ethical statements De-identified secondary datasets are provided upon request by the DHS program authority. The authors obtained permission from DHS to use the above-mentioned surveys.  Variables The outcome variables were access to SBA services and health awareness. The SBA outcome variable was binary: women who had accessed an SBA service on at least one pregnancy, and those who had not. Qualified doctors; nurses; midwifes; paramedics; health or family-welfare workers, visitors, or volunteers; or other health personnel were considered as SBAs. The health awareness outcome variable was also binary: women who lacked or had low levels of health awareness, and those who had higher levels of health awareness. Health awareness was measured from three binary variables: 1) knowledge of any modern contraceptive method (recoded: knows/does not know a method); 2) awareness of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (has heard/has not heard about STIs); and 3) knowledge about the ovulatory cycle (recoded: has/does not have correct knowledge about ovulatory cycle). Women with knowledge on two or more health factors were coded as having “higher levels of awareness”, otherwise “lacking or lower levels of awareness”. This study used twelve explanatory variables based on the literature review: respondent and partner's age, and respondent's age at first birth (all binary, split by median age); residence (urban/rural); both respondent's and her partner's education (no education/primary/secondary or higher); wealth index (poorest/poor/middle/richer/richest); sex of household head (male/female); respondent's work status in last twelve months (recoded binary variable: did not work/worked); respondent's exposure to media (recoded binary variable: exposed/not exposed to TV, radio, and/or newspapers); respondent's involvement in decision-making (recoded binary variable: not able/able to make decisions about own healthcare, a large household purchase, and/or visits to family or relatives). Country-wise variance was adjusted for by including country as a nominal explanatory variable. Wealth index was based on household possessions, quantified by principal component analysis and predetermined in each survey (Rutstein and Rojas, 2006 ).  Statistical analysis DHS-identified sampling strata, and the cluster variable at the highest level, were used to create unique clusters and strata. Each country's sampling weights were denormalised for pooled analysis (ICF International, 2012 ). Strata with only one PSU were ignored when computing the variance estimation for the logistic regression models, as variance cannot be calculated if only one PSU is sampled from a single stratum. Some respondents in the selected datasets had missing data for sociodemographic variables as well as the outcome variables. Respondents with missing data were omitted from the analysis under the assumption that data was missing at random (Bhowmik et al., 2020 ). As part of preliminary exploratory analysis, bivariate analysis was conducted to examine the distribution of the sociodemographic variables across the outcome variables. Associations were assessed using the Chi-square test of association and Cramer's V. As the outcome variables were binary, generalized linear regression models (GLMs) with quasi-binomial family of distributions (logistic regression models) were fitted to assess associations between: SBA and each sociodemographic factor, controlling for other factors; health awareness and each sociodemographic factor, controlling for other factors; and SBA and health awareness, controlling for sociodemographic factors. GLMs were fitted using R's svyglm  package (RDocumentation, n.d. 2022 ), adjusting for cluster- and strata-wise effects as well as sampling weights to be able to generalise the findings to the wider population across the SSEA region. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were fitted to all three models to check model adequacy. The present study employed a p-value threshold of 0.005, which is recommended for new discoveries for reproducibility in academic studies (Benjamin et al., 2018 ). Thus, if p-values were less than or equal to 0.005 in the fitted models, associations were considered significant. All analyses were conducted in SPSS (v.26) and R (v.3.5.3).   Results Examining the distribution of the health-awareness outcome variable and the variables used to measure it (Fig. 1  ), the results show that nearly all women in Nepal (approximately 100%), and Indonesia and the Philippines (both 99.6%), were aware of modern methods of contraception; however, women in Timor-Leste (83.1%) had the lowest levels of awareness. Women in Afghanistan (24.8%) ranked lowest on having heard of an STI, while most women in the Philippines (90.2%) and Myanmar (90.0%) ranked highest. In contrast, women in Myanmar (6.3%) and Afghanistan (8.7%) had the lowest levels of knowledge of ovulation, while women in the Philippines (27.6%) and Nepal (26.8%) had the highest. Accordingly, when all three variables were combined, women in the Philippines (92.3%) and Myanmar (89.8%) had the highest levels of health awareness; conversely, women in Afghanistan (29.6%) ranked lowest. Over 50% of women in all eight countries had accessed an SBA service (Fig. 1 ), with the highest coverage for women in Indonesia (91.1%) and lowest for women in Afghanistan (54.7%). Table 1   shows that SBA coverage was found to be significantly associated with health awareness in all countries. Across countries, over 70% of women who had higher levels of health awareness were also accessing SBA services. Table 2   and Table 3   show bivariate associations between the selected sociodemographic variables and the SBA and health awareness outcome variables, respectively. The same variables were significant for all eight countries for both outcome variables, namely, area of residence, respondent and partner's education, wealth index, exposure to media, and age at first birth (p <0.001). The number of living children was significantly associated with access to SBA services across countries (p <0.001), and with health awareness for all countries (p <0.001) except Afghanistan (p  = 0.689). The results of the fitted logistic regression models showed that respondent and partner's education, wealth index, respondent's age at first birth, respondent's involvement in decision-making, and exposure to media were significantly associated with both SBA coverage and health awareness (Table 4  ). Area of residence (p <0.001) and number of living children were significantly associated with SBA only (p  = 0.004 for two children; p <0.001 for 3 or more children), while respondent's age, age of the household head, and work status were significantly associated with health awareness (p <0.001). Four of the seven study countries outperformed Afghanistan on both SBA coverage and health awareness. Regarding SBA coverage, women in Indonesia performed best as they were 4.1 (95% CI=3.30–5.01, p <0.001) times more likely to access SBA services compared to women in Afghanistan, whereas Timor-Leste performed worse than Afghanistan (OR=0.65, 95% CI=0.54–0.79, p <0.001). Compared to women in Afghanistan, women in Myanmar were 11.1 (95% CI=8.48–14.58, p <0.001) times more likely to have higher health awareness, but women in Timor-Leste were 38.4% (95% CI=0.51–0.75, p <0.001) less likely to have higher health awareness. As the wealth index increased, women accessed more SBA services and had higher health awareness, as the richest were 6.3 and 3.2 times more likely to access these services and have greater awareness compared to the poorest quintile (p <0.001), respectively. With respect to education, women with secondary or higher education were twice as likely to access SBA services, and 4.3 times more likely to have higher levels of health awareness, respectively (p <0.001). Similar conclusions were drawn for partners’ education. Media exposure could be considered as a source of health information regarding access to SBA services. Compared to women who did not, women who had media exposure were 28.2% (95% CI=1.14–1.44, p <0.001) more likely to access SBA services, and also 90% (95% CI=1.72–2.10, p <0.001) more likely to have higher levels of health awareness. Similarly, women involved in family decision-making were 28.3% and 60.2% more likely to have access to SBA services and have higher health awareness compared to those who were not, respectively. With respect to maternal indicators, women who were older than 20 years upon having their firstborn were 22.1% (p <0.001) more likely to use SBA services, and 27.6% (p <0.001) more likely to have higher health awareness compared to younger mothers. The likelihood of access to SBA services progressively decreased for women with greater numbers of living children (p <0.001). Women living in rural areas were also 22.7% less likely to access SBA services than urban women. When health awareness was modelled with SBA coverage, women with higher health awareness were found to be 44.4% (OR=1.44, 95% CI=1.32–1.58, p <0.001) more likely to access SBAs compared to women who had limited health awareness. In the pooled sample, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the models fitted for SBA; health awareness; and SBA with health awareness added as a covariate were 0.81, 0.77, and 0.82 respectively. This shows good model fit (Mandrekar, 2010 ). The ROC curves are provided in the supplementary file. The supplementary file also contains variance inflation factor (VIF) values for all models, which also showed the absence of any multicollinearity.  Discussion The aim of this study was to identify important sociodemographic factors that are associated with health awareness and SBA coverage for the selected LMICs in the SSEA region, with the intent of assessing progress on achieving the UN's SDG 3.1 of reducing MMRs in this region. Respondent and partner's education, wealth index, respondent's age at first birth, respondent's involvement in decision-making, and exposure to media were found to be associated with both SBA coverage and health awareness. Women with greater health awareness were found to be more likely to access SBAs. After controlling for health awareness, Timor-Leste, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Nepal were underperforming on SBA coverage compared to other countries in the SSEA region. This study found that women living in rural areas were less likely to access SBA services. This aligns with past studies as progress towards achieving universal SBA coverage is slower in rural areas (Metcalfe and Adegoke, 2013 ; UNICEF, 2018 ). Despite geographic spread, remote communities are nowadays exposed to health information through media and technological innovations (UN Economic and Social Council (UNECOSOC), 2010 ). The degree of mobile ownership and communication was found to be similar in rural and urban locations in India, Indonesia, and Pakistan (Sylvester, 2016 ), which could lead to uniform health awareness countrywide. However, rural areas suffer from resource shortages which could hamper implementation and delivery of effective healthcare (UNECOSOC, 2010). Such logistical barriers may prevent rural communities from accessing services such as SBAs despite levels of health-awareness. Women who had secondary education or higher, and/or had partners who did so, were more likely to access SBA services. Women's education was observed to be a strong predictor of health-service use, with secondary education a strong predictor of SBA coverage for women in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka (El-Saharty et al., 2017 ). It is argued that more than a basic level of education is needed to achieve SDG 3.1 targets (Bhowmik et al., 2020 ). An educated partner is more likely to attend antenatal-care visits with their pregnant partners (Alemi et al., 2020 ), which could suggest that educated partners have greater awareness about the importance of maternal care. Formal education, preferably at the secondary or higher level, allows both men and women to better seek, understand, and apply health information (Unite for Sight, 2015 ). Financial stability was found to be associated with a higher likelihood of access to SBA services and greater health awareness. It is observed that progress towards achieving universal SBA coverage is slower for women from poorer households (UNICEF, 2018 ; Rajah et al., 2019 ). With more financial resources, richer households can afford better, and more regular, healthcare (Peters et al., 2008 ), which in turn is likely to improve family members’ health awareness. Conversely, owing to financial constraints, despite reporting worse health outcomes members of poorer households will be more likely to avoid seeking medical care (Peters et al., 2008 ) and opt for cheaper treatments (Das and Gertler, 2007 ), which could limit their exposure to health information and SBA services. Women who were younger (≤20 years) at first birth and not involved in family decision-making were found to access SBA services less and have lower health awareness. These factors - young motherhood and disempowerment - are associated. For example, in Nepal, older partners of younger women, compared to older women, were found to be the sole decision-makers about pregnancy-related matters and contraceptives use (WHO, 2007a ), and Nepalese women who were younger upon first giving birth were found to be less likely to use maternal-health services (Pandey et al., 2012 ). In patriarchal societies, men and in-laws typically make important family decisions on behalf of the women in their families. These include decisions about women's access to family planning and the place of delivery, as was the case in Timor-Leste (King and Jones, 2019 ). Younger mothers, especially, often have no say regarding their own healthcare and must defer to partners and/or in-laws for such decision-making (Presler-Marshall and Jones, 2012 ). Thus, lack of empowerment over their own healthcare decisions may explain why use of maternal health services was found to be lower amongst younger mothers. However, SBA-assisted deliveries also decreased as the number of children increased, which is consistent with past findings (Metcalf and Adegoke, 2013 ). This could be because mothers with growing birthing experience might feel increasingly less apprehensive about risks associated with more traditional delivery methods (Dhakal et al., 2017 ). Having greater exposure to media led to higher access to SBA services and health awareness for women. There is a positive relationship between regular access to general information through media and utilisation of maternal health services (Nguyen et al., 2012 ). In developing countries, mass media is used as a means of providing routine healthcare messages to the general population (Biswas et al., 2020 ). Women who regularly watch TV or read newspapers are likely to gain insights on health information to enhance their health knowledge and thereby become more aware of the importance of accessing services during pregnancy. Women older than 30 years, whose head of household was older than 40 years, and who had worked in the last 12 months had significantly higher health awareness, but showed no difference regarding access to SBA services. These findings complement the argument that women with decision-making power are more likely to have greater health awareness. Examining the association between maternal autonomy and low birth weight in India, Chakraborty and Anderson (2011) found that women with low autonomy were more likely to be younger, unemployed, and living in households headed by their in-laws and/or males. Women involved in income-generating activities have more authority over their healthcare choices, and women who are more advanced in age would have more experience and knowledge of various health issues. The overall strength of this study is that it used nationally representative data for eight LMICs to estimate population-level effects for the SSEA region. The sample sizes for each country-level dataset were large, which allowed estimations to be made for both outcome variables. The study also provides an estimation on the degree of contribution that health awareness makes on SBA coverage in LMICs. This is an area which is often ignored in literature, and as such, this gap reflects a failure to recognise the necessity of disseminating health information to soon-to-be mothers. The findings of the study could contribute to policy decision-making for LMICs of the SSEA region. This study also provides an avenue to quantify similar estimations for other regions around the globe. The results show that education in LMICs can help increase the uptake of SBA services. In line with the findings of this study, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) (2015 ) provided an overview of the status of comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) implementation and coverage on a global scale. CSE is identified to have a positive impact on sexual- and reproductive-health outcomes, and UNESCO (2015 ) identifies that effective sexuality education starts early in childhood and progresses through adolescence and adulthood. In India, it has been found that school-based sexuality education for adolescents increases their knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours related to sexual- and reproductive-health outcomes (Vincent and Krishnakumar, 2022 ). Education is frequently stressed as one of the most important components to increase health accessibility (Bhowmik et al., 2020 ; El-Saharty et al., 2017 ); LMICs therefore need to introduce policies with a target to increase both formal education and informal health awareness. These policies should be in congruence with different campaigns of non-governmental organisations. Pilot studies targeting the disadvantaged women identified in this paper can be run in successful countries. This study had a few limitations. First, the health-awareness outcome variable was measured from three health-related variables. Other available variables were excluded as they were missing in multiple surveys. Thus, interpretation of health-awareness in this study requires caution. Future studies with access to a wider range of data, and that are backed by a theoretical framework, can provide a better estimation of the effect of health-awareness. Second, three surveys were excluded from the study. The Vietnam (2005) and Bangladesh (2014) DHSs were excluded as several variables of interest were missing from the dataset, and the Cambodia DHS (2014) was excluded as it did not have usable data for one of the outcome variables. Third, as this study used cross-sectional data, no causal inferences can be made. Fourth, while there were low percentages of missing data across countries for the health-awareness outcome variable, the percentages of missing data for the SBA variable were higher. Finally, as DHSs do not include a measure of the MMR, it is not possible to estimate the effects of SBA access and health-awareness on the MMR. However, counterfactual analysis in future could address this matter. Future DHS surveys could also consider addressing the first two limitations. Interventional studies could be designed to draw causal inferences about women's access to SBA services and increased health awareness.  Conclusion Globally, an unacceptable number of women are dying daily from pregnancy- and childbirth-related issues. Maternal mortality in the SSEA region remains high. This study identified a women who need greater attention from policymakers in the selected LMICs, if these countries intend to achieve SDG 3.1 by 2030. The identified disadvantaged women were those who themselves and/or whose partners lack or only have a primary-level education, were poor, reside in rural areas, were young mothers (aged ≤20 years) with more than one child, were not exposed to media, and were not participating in family decision-making. This group of women could be targeted by implementing effective intervention programs, particularly in Timor-Leste, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Nepal, which are underperforming within the SSEA region. Regular assessment of SBA coverage would enable policymakers to evaluate the underlying reasons for nationwide service gaps, and thereafter devise possible intervention strategies and programs to minimise gaps in SBA coverage.
