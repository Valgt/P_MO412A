                  Dealing with current and future global challenges, corporate social responsibility has become a key element for sustainable and responsible companies. Roquette, a family-owned group, leader in plant-based ingredients for Food, Nutrition and Health markets, has implemented a sustainable development approach applicable to all its worldwide activities. This “sustainable journey” is based on 4 pillars: sourcing, innovating, biorefining and acting. For each cornerstone, the company has defined several commitments and key performance indicators (KPIs) with continuous improvement goals and specific 2025 targets. In the specific case of innovation, Roquette has set up 2 KPIs to ensure the sustainability of its developments (KPI-1) and the one of the solutions offered to customers and end-users (KPI-2). Respectively based on green chemistry principles and UN sustainable development goals, these KPIs have been implemented at Roquette last year. In 2016, the value of KPI-1 was 53% and that of KPI-2 was 62%. In 2025, Roquette is committed to achieve that a minimum of 70% of its innovation projects meet the criteria of green chemistry (KPI-1 ≥ 70%) and that a minimum of 80% of its innovative solutions offered to customers meet the criteria of sustainable solutions (KPI-2 ≥ 80%).

Roquette general presentation A family-owned group serving customers globally, Roquette is a leader in specialty food ingredients and pharmaceutical excipients [1] . The products and solutions developed by the Group deliver proven technological, nutritional and health benefits precisely tailored to the pharma, nutrition, food and selected industry markets. Roquette's offer is produced from plant-based raw materials such as corn, wheat, potatoes and peas. Since its foundation over 80 years ago, the Group's growth has been based on innovation, a passion for the job and a commitment to achieve. Satisfying its customers and anticipating their needs is the Group's number one priority. In order to provide them with the most appropriate solutions, Roquette optimizes all components of renewable raw materials by drawing on its expertise. These high-potential natural resources allow Roquette to offer a broad range of products and solutions in the fields of food and human nutrition, pharma, animal nutrition as well as other industry sectors. As such, the Group proposes over 700 products worldwide. Some examples of applications developed with our customers• Food & human nutrition    Our plant-based solutions with nutritional and health benefits enable us to offer solutions that are adapted to people with diabetes thanks to our ingredients with a low glycemic index (NUTRIOSE® soluble fiber, SWEETPEARL® maltitol) or help prevent sarcopenia – muscle weakening – which affects seniors (NUTRALYS® plant proteins).• Pharma    Excipients, raw materials and active ingredients make up a wide range of products with multiple uses for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry, which serve to facilitate medicine intake. The dosage formulation for orodispersible tablets does not require water and melts in the mouth (PEARLITOL® Flash).• Industry    Our solutions derived from renewable plant resources are both effective and competitive. They meet changing market demands and serve to provide proven technological benefits to performance plastics and thermosetting resins (POLYSORB® isosorbide). Roquette's industrial know-how, which is driven by a longstanding tradition of engaging in research and innovation, enables Roquette to be at the cutting-edge of solutions. It guarantees the high quality of Roquette's products and services, appreciated by its customers around the world. Roquette operates in over 100 countries, has a turnover of 3.2 billion euros and currently employs more than 8300 people worldwide. Every day, Roquette contributes to improving the health and well-being of millions of consumers around the world.  Sustainability at Roquette For over 80 years now, the success of the Group has been rooted in strong values. Every day, Roquette is committed to working in harmony with local communities. Respecting the environment, preserving natural resources and safeguarding people's well-being are essential to Roquette. As the Group is aware of the challenges facing the world in the years to come, it has initiated a process of Corporate Social Responsibility applicable to all its sites and all its activities around the world. This process is an integral part of the company's business, and it is built on four responsibly developed cornerstones: sourcing, biorefining, acting, and innovating. It also includes specific commitments in terms of sustainable development in all of the key operations of the Group with concrete targets to be reached by 2025.• Sourcing    Given an annual consumption of millions of tons of plant-based raw materials derived from agriculture and as such annually renewable, Roquette manages its supplies with a vision of sustainability based on 3 commitments:- Source sustainably,  - Improve continuously its raw material quality,  - Strengthen relationship with its raw materials suppliers.    Since 2016, Roquette has a measurable goal: by 2025, Roquette is committed to ensuring that at least 20% of its plant-based raw material supplies be certified or rated as “sustainable and responsible”.• Biorefining    For more than 80 years, Roquette has had an approach where sustainable development is intrinsically present in its industrial activities and based on four pillars:- Use of plant-based annually renewable raw materials,  - Most industrial processes based on water,  - Most of the substances used in the factories with a favorable environmental impact,  - Very little waste produced.    The improvement of its industrial sustainability remains at the heart of Roquette's concerns. Compared to 2015, Roquette is committed to reduce its energy intensity by 10% by 2025, while implementing technical solutions and use of renewable energy, i.e. an expected overall reduction of one million CO2  tons. Roquette also intends to reduce its consumption of water drawn from natural environments by 20% versus 2015.• Acting    Roquette puts health, safety and well-being at the heart of its concerns in all its activities. By 2025, Roquette is committed to achieving a Frequency rate 1 (FR1) of 0.5 against 2.2 in 2016 (FR1 = number of accidents with work stoppage per million hours worked). Besides this, Roquette, driven by its 8300 employees across the world, embraces diversity as a major strength and promotes the sharing of best practices in this multicultural network. Roquette also develops activities with the local communities in order to contribute to their development through sustainable relationships, with a commitment of supporting a minimum of 20 community projects every year.• Innovating    Roquette uses natural plant-based resources and transforms them in order to better respond to the needs of its customers and consumers. Roquette is therefore keen on ensuring that its new industrial processes align as much as possible with the principles of sustainable development. Thus, by 2025, Roquette is committed to ensuring that a minimum of 70% of its innovation projects strictly meet the criteria of sustainable green chemistry. The commitment of Roquette also involves the willingness to make customers and consumers themselves benefit from sustainability. By 2025, 80% of the new innovative solutions offered by Roquette to customers will have to meet at least one of the three Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (UN) [2]  in a compatible way with Roquette's developments, i.e. improvement of well-being and health, access and improvement of water treatment as well as more responsible consumption and production.  Roquette's commitment to sustainable innovation Let's now go into more detail on the approach adopted for innovation at Roquette in order to improve sustainability.• Sustainability of innovation projects    As already mentioned, Roquette does start off with natural resources and transforms them through industrial processes of different kinds: physical separation in the biorefinery part but also thereafter processes of chemical and/or biotechnological modification. In order to ensure that its processes are truly sustainable, Roquette has recently developed objective measurement criteria based on the 12 principles of green chemistry initially proposed by P.T. Anastas and J.C. Warner [3] . Based on this approach, Roquette has defined 4 internal criteria for measuring the sustainable development impact of its innovation projects:- Waste prevention (based on principle 1 of green chemistry);  - Atom economy, high yield (based on principles 2 & 8);  - Reduction of hazards (based on principles 3, 4, 5 & 12);  - Energy efficiency and benign operating conditions (based on principles 6 & 12).    Each criterion is rated on a scale from 0 (worse) to 5 (better) following specific internal rules. The overall rating ranges from 0 (worst) to 20 (best) and defines the overall level of sustainability for the innovation projects (see Table 1  ). The innovation projects rated 14 or more are considered to be truly sustainable. Conversely, the innovation projects rated 10 or below have poor sustainability outcomes. Between these two scenarios, projects are considered as neutral in terms of sustainability. Roquette considers that its innovation projects must lead to an improvement in the sustainability of the related processes. To verify this, Roquette set up the following key performance indicator:KPI-1 = (number of Sustainable & Sustainable + innovation projects)/(total number of innovation projects)    In 2016, the value of KPI-1 was 53%. Most of the ongoing projects that are not considered completely satisfactory in terms of sustainability were classified as neutral. In 2025, Roquette is committed to achieve that a minimum of 70% of its innovation projects meet the criteria of green chemistry (KPI-1 ≥ 70%).• Sustainability of the innovative solutions for customers and/or end consumers    As already mentioned, assessing the sustainability of the innovative solutions proposed at our customers and/or the consumers is based on the new UN Sustainable Development Agenda adopted on the 25th of September 2015. At that date, the United Nations adopted a set of goals to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all human beings. As all the 17 goals of the United Nations Agenda cannot be applied to its developments, Roquette chose to retain three of them:- Good health & wellbeing (UN goal 3),  - Clean water & sanitation (UN goal 6),  - Responsible consumption & production at our customers and/or consumers (UN goal 12).    For each of these goals, Roquette developed internally specific criteria which make it possible to verify that the new solutions offered to customers also bring them a benefit in terms of sustainability. Roquette also defined a specific indicator:KPI-2 = (number of sustainable innovative solutions offered to customers and/or end consumers)/(total number of innovative solutions)    In 2016, the value of KPI-2 is 62%. In 2025, Roquette is committed to achieve that a minimum of 80% of its innovative solutions offered to customers meet the criteria of sustainable solutions (KPI-2 ≥ 80%).
