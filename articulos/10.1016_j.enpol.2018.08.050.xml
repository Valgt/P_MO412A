                  India has adopted the 2030 Agenda during the United Nations Summit held in September 2015. Energy is intimately connected with 74% of the 169 targets related to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. Subsequently, India has also submitted its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for the period 2021–2030 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While the Government of India (GOI) has ambitious plans for enhancing the installed capacity of RE sources, 75% of its electricity is currently generated by coal-fired power plants. As India's electricity requirements grow to meet the aspirations of 1.3 Bi people, it needs a policy framework that integrates all low-carbon energy technologies with coal in such a manner that the reliability, security, and affordability of electric supply are balanced with sustainable development. India also needs to develop innovative strategies to clean up the country's coal sector while enhancing the integration of renewable energy into the National Power Grid. In this context, certain recommendations are proposed in this article for timely implementation by GOI to facilitate the achievement of India's targets with respect to SDG 7 and the NDCs in an efficient and effective manner.

                  <ce:simple-para id="sp0025" view="all">India has adopted the 2030 Agenda during the United Nations Summit held in September 2015. Energy is intimately connected with 74% of the 169 targets related to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. Subsequently, India has also submitted its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for the period 2021–2030 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While the Government of India (GOI) has ambitious plans for enhancing the installed capacity of RE sources, 75% of its electricity is currently generated by coal-fired power plants. As India's electricity requirements grow to meet the aspirations of 1.3 Bi people, it needs a policy framework that integrates all low-carbon energy technologies with coal in such a manner that the reliability, security, and affordability of electric supply are balanced with sustainable development. India also needs to develop innovative strategies to clean up the country's coal sector while enhancing the integration of renewable energy into the National Power Grid. In this context, certain recommendations are proposed in this article for timely implementation by GOI to facilitate the achievement of India's targets with respect to SDG 7 and the NDCs in an efficient and effective manner.</ce:simple-para>

                  <ce:para id="p0070" view="all">India is the third largest electricity generator in the World behind China and USA, but its per capita electricity consumption of 1117 kWh in 2017 was less than one-fourth that of China, and one-third of the World average (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0005" refid="bib4 bib114">BP, 2018a; World Bank, 2018</ce:cross-refs>). During the Financial Year 2017–18 (FY 18), coal, gas, hydro, nuclear, and Renewable Energy (RE) sources (including, wind, solar, bio-energy, small hydro) contributed: 75%, 4%, 10%, 3%, and 8%, respectively of the 1309 TWh of total electricity generated by utilities in India (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0075" refid="bib15">CEA, 2018a</ce:cross-ref>). Non-utilities (captive power plants that produce electricity largely for consumption in their own industrial plant(s) and release the surplus to the grid) generated 19.7 TWh in FY 17 on top of the 1242 TWh generated by utilities in that year (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0080" refid="bib91">MOSPI, 2018</ce:cross-ref>). During FY 18, the share of CPPs in the total electricity generated in India varied between 70% (during the monsoon months of July and August 2017 when large hydropower plants contributed 14.7% of the total electricity generated) and 80% (during the post-monsoon months of January and February 2018) with an annual average of just over 75% (see <ce:float-anchor refid="f0005"/>

                  <ce:para id="p0075" view="all">The installed capacity of electricity generation in India increased by 99.2 GW between April 2012 and March 2017 against a targeted expansion of 88.5 GW (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0090" refid="bib15">CEA, 2018a</ce:cross-ref>). As a result, the All-India average energy deficit (gap between ‘energy requirement’ and ‘energy supplied’) was only 0.7% during FY 18, while the power deficit (gap between ‘peak demand’ and ‘peak met’) was approximately 2% during the same period (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0095" refid="bib84">MOP, 2018a</ce:cross-ref>). These figures indicate a great improvement in electricity supply when compared with the All-India average energy deficit of 8.7% and power deficit of 9% as recently as in FY 13 (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0100" refid="bib16">CEA, 2018b</ce:cross-ref>). However, several CPPs in India are under financial stress due to the lack of inadequate demand in the form of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) from State-owned Power Distribution Companies or DISCOMS (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0105" refid="bib53">Lok Sabha, 2018a</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0080" view="all">Electricity is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution of India. Distribution of electricity and management of associated functions are handled by DISCOMS which are largely owned by the respective State Governments. Therefore, the inherent variability in the quality of governance in each State has resulted in disparities not only in the last mile electricity distribution systems in the respective States but also in the financial health of the DISCOMS serving these States. These disparities are also evident in the large variations between the power deficits in different regions as well as between the States. For example, the State of Maharashtra with the highest power demand of 23.4 GW during FY 18 had a power deficit of only 0.2%, while the State of Uttar Pradesh which had the second highest peak demand in India (20.5 GW) had a power deficit of 10.9% during the same period (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0110" refid="bib86">MOP, 2018c</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0085" view="all">According to India's Ministry of Power (MOP), of the 177 million rural households in the country, only 152 million (86%) have been provided with an electrical connection as on 11 July 2018 (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0115" refid="bib85">MOP, 2018b</ce:cross-ref>). On the other hand, the Ministry has also declared that India is a power ‘surplus’ country because the total installed electricity generation capacity in the country exceeds 344 GW against a peak demand which has never exceeded 170 GW till date (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0120" refid="bib86">MOP, 2018c</ce:cross-ref>). The deficit in supply to the aforesaid 25 million rural households is primarily because of the DISCOMs’ reluctance to procure power from the generating companies, either because they lack the funds required to procure adequate quantum of power to meet the unserved/under-served demand or because they want to limit their losses due to under-recoveries from these consumers, or both. Further, several DISCOMS in India resort to power cuts during peak hours rather than procuring costlier power to meet the peak demand.</ce:para>

In line with the increasing requirement of electrical energy, the peak electricity demand is projected to increase from the FY 18 level of 164 GW to 226 GW in 2022 and further to 299 GW in FY 27 (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0010" refid="bib84 bib87">MOP, 2018a, 2018d</ce:cross-refs>). As of 31 March 2018, fossil fuel sources have a share of 65% in the total electrical generation capacity of electrical utilities in India, while non-fossil fuel (hydro, nuclear, and RE) sources have the balance 35% of generation capacity in India (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0135" refid="bib18">CEA, 2018d</ce:cross-ref>). Further, power plants with a total generation capacity of 58 GW comprising of 48 GW thermal, 6.8 GW hydro, and 3.3 GW nuclear, are at various stages of construction. These new power plants will progressively replace old and inefficient CPPs with a combined capacity of 22.7 GW that are not in a position to comply with current environment norms (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0140" refid="bib87">MOP, 2018d</ce:cross-ref>). In addition, GOI is also projecting an increase in RE capacity to 175 GW by March 2022 from the March 2018 level of 69 GW (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0015" refid="bib16 bib18">CEA, 2018b, 2018d</ce:cross-refs>). Even after the generation capacity of RE sources reaches the projected level of 175 GW by FY 22, RE sources are expected to generate only 19% of the electricity produced in India in FY 22 compared to their current share of 8% (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0020" refid="bib15 bib87">CEA, 2018a; MOP, 2018d</ce:cross-refs>). However, the share of RE in the total electricity generated in the Southern and Western regions of the country will be much higher than the All-India average (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0145" refid="bib94">NREL, 2017a, 2017b</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>

The base case studied by this committee is based on GOI's projections for RE generation capacity to reach 175 GW by March 2022 and 275 GW by March 2027. In this base case scenario, CPPs are projected to generate 63% and 56% of the total electricity generated by utilities in FY 22 and FY 27, respectively (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0155" refid="bib87">MOP, 2018d</ce:cross-ref>). However, in absolute terms, coal-based generation by utilities is expected to increase from 986 TWh in FY 18 to 1072 TWh in FY 22 and further to 1239 TWh in FY 27 (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0025" refid="bib15 bib87">CEA, 2018a; MOP, 2018d</ce:cross-refs>). If GOI's projections for 175 GW of RE capacity in 2022 are not realized, the share of CPPs during 2022 will increase beyond their projected share of 63% in the base case since CPPs are currently underutilized in India (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0160" refid="bib17">CEA, 2018c</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0115" view="all">The dependence on coal for power generation in India is due to its relative abundance within the country.

On a reserve basis, India has the 5th largest endowment with 9.4% (98 billion tons or BT) of the world's proved coal reserves at the end of 2017, but just 0.3% and 0.6% of world's oil and natural gas reserves, respectively (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0170" refid="bib5">BP, 2018b</ce:cross-ref>). In India, coal has a reserve to production ratio (defined as the ratio of the remaining proven reserves that are economically recoverable at the end of any year to the production in that year) of 136, whereas the corresponding figures for oil and gas are only 14 and 44 years, respectively (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0175" refid="bib5">BP, 2018b</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>

GOI has enacted a number of policy measures for increasing the share of renewable energy in India's energy mix (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0290" refid="bib66">MNRE, 2018b</ce:cross-ref>). As a result, electricity generation by RE sources has increased from 5.6% of total electricity generated by Indian utilities in FY 16 to reach a level of 8% during FY 18 (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0295" refid="bib65">MNRE, 2018a</ce:cross-ref>).

                  <ce:para id="p0195" view="all">In order to provide a framework for procurement of solar and wind power through a transparent, standardized process of tariff-based bidding, India's Ministry of Power (MOP) has issued Standard Bidding Guidelines (SBG) for tariff-based competitive bidding for solar power and wind power on 3 August 2017 and 8 December 2017, respectively (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0045" refid="bib82 bib83">MOP, 2017b, 2017c</ce:cross-refs>). During the auctions conducted by power procurers adopting these SBGs, wind and solar energy tariffs have dropped below Rs.3 per kWh from the tariffs exceeding Rs.5 per kWh prior to 2014 (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0305" refid="bib54">Lok Sabha, 2018b</ce:cross-ref>). By March 2018, wind power (34 GW) accounted for nearly 50% of the total RE capacity in India (69 GW) and 55% of electricity generated by RE sources in India (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0310" refid="bib15">CEA, 2018a</ce:cross-ref>).

While the slippage with respect to MNRE's target for solar and wind energy capacity addition (combined) was 31% in FY 17, the slippage reduced to 21% in FY 18 (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0050" refid="bib12 bib13 bib18 bib54">CEA, 2016, 2017a, 2018d; Lok Sabha, 2018b</ce:cross-refs>). Therefore, the cumulative shortfall of 7.84 GW (26%) with respect to the cumulative target of 30 GW in the total addition to the generation capacity of wind and solar energy during the last two years must be compensated in the next four years to achieve GOI's target of 175 GW of RE by 2022.</ce:para>

This scheme seeks to reduce the gap between the Average Cost of Supply (ACS) and the Average Revenue Realized (ARR) to zero by FY 19 as per defined trajectories to ensure the viability of the DISCOMS. However, more than two years after the introduction of the 'UDAY' scheme, the average of AT &amp; C losses of DISCOMs on an All-India basis has hardly reduced from 20.74% in FY 16 to 18.76% in FY 18, though there is a wide variation in the AT &amp; C losses incurred in various DISCOMs of India (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0060" refid="bib88 bib108">MOP, 2018e; UDAY, 2018</ce:cross-refs>). In general, the AT &amp; C losses are higher in the DISCOMs of poorer States of India like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar than in the relatively developed States like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Since we are already in the middle of FY 19, the DISCOMS will have to ramp up the identified technical and operational measures monitored by UDAY in order to reduce the AT &amp; C losses to 15% by the end of FY 19 as per ‘UDAY’ targets (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0065" refid="bib88 bib108">MOP, 2018e; UDAY, 2018</ce:cross-refs>). Many of these measures need better governance at the local level as well as more financial assistance from GOI to enable DISCOMS to implement changes like, laying of underground cables (in place of overhead lines) to reduce power theft, upgradation of ‘last mile’ sub-distribution systems, provision of pre-paid meters for rural residential consumers, installation of ‘smart’ meters for industrial and commercial consumers, and separation of rural feeders—all backed by a more effective law and order machinery.</ce:para>

More recently, the ACS-ARR gap during the first nine months of FY 18 has further reduced to Rs.0.28/kWh from Rs.0.47/kWh during the corresponding period in FY 17, against the goal of reaching zero by FY 19 (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0340" refid="bib108">UDAY, 2018</ce:cross-ref>).

They have estimated that a consumption of 8–10 LPG cylinders (14.2 kg each) per year in each household is equivalent to an electricity consumption of approximately 1400 kWh per year which is 27% higher than India's per capita electricity consumption in 2017.

Therefore, MOP has approved a project comprising inter-State and intra-State transmission systems collectively called ‘Green Energy Corridors (GEC)’ to be completed by 2020 to facilitate the integration of 175 GW of RE (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0380" refid="bib98">PIB, 2016a</ce:cross-ref>). The inter-State transmission system component of the GEC project involving 3200 circuit kilometers of transmission lines and 18,000 MVA of substation capacity is scheduled to be completed by May 2019 at an approximate cost of Rs.114 Bi. The intra-State transmission system component of the GEC project consisting of 9400 circuit kilometers of transmission lines and 19,000 MVA of substation capacity is being implemented by the respective State utilities at an approved cost of Rs.101 Bi. Further, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has also studied the impact of adding 160 GW of solar and wind energy to the Grid. These studies have indicated the need to implement policies like merit-order based power dispatches at a regional level (in place of the current State-level merit order system) and compensation for ancillary services. These studies have also stressed the need to identify optimal locations for new RE and associated inter- and intra-state transmission systems to integrate 70 GW of solar and wind energy in the RE-rich Southern Region Grid by 2022 as planned (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0075" refid="bib94 bib95">NREL, 2017a, 2017b, 2017c</ce:cross-refs>).</ce:para>

The conventional generators also have to be ramped up when RE generation goes down while the power demand is constant or is increasing. The ramp rate of a sub-critical CPP is in the range of 1–1.5% per minute while it is 3% per minute for a super-critical CPP (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0390" refid="bib14">CEA, 2017b</ce:cross-ref>). Ramp rates for combined cycle (widely used technology for gas-based power in India) gas-based power plants are up to 10% per minute, while that for Hydro-Electric Projects (HEPs) can be as high as 50% per minute. Therefore, hydropower is vital for balancing the grid as well as to meet the peak demand as the proportion of RE ramps up towards GOI's 175 GW target. However, the share of hydropower in India's electricity generation capacity has decreased from 25% in FY 08 to 13.5% in FY 18, while the contribution of hydropower to the total amount of electricity generated by utilities in India has reduced from 17.5% to 10.4% during the same period (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0395" refid="bib11">CEA, 2008</ce:cross-ref>; <ce:cross-ref id="cr0400" refid="bib15">CEA, 2018a</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>

In addition, CEA has recommended construction of balancing facilities in some of the existing HEPs to operate them as Pumped Storage Plants (PSPs) as originally envisaged, since the use of hydro-power is a proven, cost-effective strategy to handle the intermittent and variable power generated by RE sources (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0415" refid="bib16">CEA, 2018b</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>

In April 2018, GOI-controlled NLC India Limited completed an auction for a 20 MW solar power project integrated with 8 MWh of storage capacity in the Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands to replace the DG sets used to provide power in these remote islands at competitive prices (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0430" refid="bib103">PV Tech, 2018</ce:cross-ref>).

The higher (compared to BIS/IEC standards and/or manufacturers’ specifications) degradation rates of the solar PV modules installed in the solar power plants located in ‘Hot’ Zones” or on solar rooftops are likely to affect power generation over the 25-year duration of a PPA, unless these solar PV modules are replaced at suitable intervals depending on the actual degradation rates of the solar PV modules. Therefore, assessment of the initial quality, as well as the long-term performance of solar PV modules through audits at the time of installation and at regular intervals thereafter is necessary to ensure that the projections of solar energy required to meet India's growing needs for RE are satisfied, now and in the future.</ce:para>

For example, GOI-controlled NTPC is replacing its obsolete, inefficient, and non-compliant CPPs with new CPPs based on SC/USC technology which will be equipped with environment-friendly features like, high-efficiency airborne dust control systems and SOx and NOx emission controls to comply with EPAR, as well as dry-ash disposal and zero liquid discharge systems (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0655" refid="bib96">NTPC, 2017</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0450" view="all">Since 22 June 2010, GOI has been levying a carbon tax in the name of ‘Clean Energy Cess’ on all coal and lignite used in India, whether by domestic production or through imports. The funds collected from this cess were originally earmarked for the purposes of financing and promoting clean energy initiatives, including ‘<ce:italic>projects which result in replacing existing technology in energy generation with a more environmentally sustainable approach</ce:italic>,’ through the ‘National Clean Energy Fund’ (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0660" refid="bib28">DOE, 2011</ce:cross-ref>). This cess was initially levied @ Rs.50 per ton of coal used in India and has been doubled three times since June 2014 to its current rate of Rs.400 per ton from 1 March 2016 onwards (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0665" refid="bib29">DOE, 2018</ce:cross-ref>) after GOI renamed it as ‘Clean Environment Cess.’ Consequently, the National Clean Energy Fund was also renamed as the National Clean Energy and Environment Fund (NCEEF) in 2016 (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0670" refid="bib29">DOE, 2018</ce:cross-ref>). MNRE has utilized most of the Rs.214 billion it has received from the NCEEF to promote RE capacity additions (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0675" refid="bib54">Lok Sabha, 2018b</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0455" view="all">CERC has held that GOI's imposition of the Clean Energy/Environment Cess (Cess) constitutes a ‘Change of Law’ in all Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) entered into by CPPs under the Electricity Act (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0105" refid="bib19 bib20">CERC, 2017, 2018</ce:cross-refs>). Therefore, CPPs have raised their tariffs to pass on the cost of this Cess to all power consumers as per the terms of their PPA. However, in a perverse move, GOI has subsumed this Cess into the GST Compensation Fund from 1 July 2017 onwards and has declared that the money received by levying this Cess from this date onwards will not be used to fund the NCEF (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0110" refid="bib63 bib80">MLJ, 2017; MOF, 2018c</ce:cross-refs>). Given that coal-based power will remain central to India's electricity supply, it is critical for GOI to reduce the power sector's environmental footprint by extending concessional finance to CPPs for retrofitting their plants to comply with EPAR (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0115" refid="bib22 bib89">CSE, 2017; MOP, 2018f</ce:cross-refs>). This will avoid double taxation of Indians to just to enable them to realize their Fundamental Right to a clean environment since the entire burden of this Cess is already being passed through to all power consumers in the form of higher tariffs.</ce:para>

However, vast sums of money totaling to more than Rs.420 billion (‘CAMPA funds’) paid by user agencies to the State forest departments as compensation for forest lands diverted by them for non-forest use were lying unutilized for years due to the absence of a permanent mechanism to utilize these funds (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0690" refid="bib33">Economic Times, 2017</ce:cross-ref>). A High-Level Committee (HLC) appointed by GOI has pointed out the need to increase the capacity of the Forest department in the States to ensure effective utilization of CAMPA funds needed to achieve NFP's prime goal.
