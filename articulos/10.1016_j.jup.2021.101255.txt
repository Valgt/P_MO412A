                  This article analyzes water governance models in the context of sustainable development. Specifically, it aims to understand which dimensions of these models need to be rethought to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the UN 2030 Agenda, especially SDG#6, considering the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We present a broad review of the literature from a database containing 118 publications from 2015 to 2020. The data collection process was structured in two phases: collecting articles from the ISI Web of Science and Google Scholars and a content analysis of the selected papers. The findings highlight that collaboration, coordination and stakeholder engagement are the crucial elements that water governance models should include to address the global sustainability challenge. How these principles can be translated into practice to enhance water resource management at the local level appears crucial but has been under-investigated in the literature, so a clear pathway toward sustainability is lacking. Implications for academia and management are discussed.

Keywords Water governance model  Water sustainability governance models  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  Resilience theory  COVID-19 pandemic    1 Introduction Over the last four decades, researchers have paid increasing attention to sustainable development issues in water services, especially governance, management and technical solutions (de Silva et al., 2020 ; Lawson et al., 2020 ; Schiedek, 2020 ; Tosun and Scherer, 2020 ; Glass and Newig, 2019 ). The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2015 ; 2010 ) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (United Nations, 2020 ) have highlighted the critical role water governance plays in sustainability issues. The OECD (2015 ; 2010 ) has introduced good governance practices to address water crises, as governance gaps hinder the design and implementation of technical and non-technical solutions identified in water policies. In the same line, water sustainability issues have been included in the UN 2030 Agenda1  1 For more details on SDGs, please see https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda .   and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which provides a common framework for measuring sustainable development from a social, economic and environmental perspective (Glass and Newig, 2019 ; Woodhouse and Muller, 2017 ). However, the UN 2030 Agenda appears not to be in line with UNEP (2012) , highlighting the need for “aligning governance to the challenges of global sustainability”. Even though water governance has been recognized as a crucial factor in sustained progress towards achieving SDG#6 - to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all - it is still unclear which governance model(s) can be considered sustainable (Martinez-Cordoba et al., 2020 ; Jimenez et al., 2020 ; Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ). The UN 2030 Agenda does not specify how  water governance models should include SDGs, leaving the task of identifying solutions to practitioners and national and local governments (LGs) (Biermann et al., 2014 ). Specifically, SDG#6 identifies a “way to manage the water resource” by introducing Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), which is a managerial solution, as a tangible target for better governance of water resources (van der Bliek et al., 2014 ). Much of the literature on water governance focuses on meeting the objectives of IWRM (Benson et al., 2020 ; Nshimbi, 2019 ; Bertule et al., 2018 ; Hussein et al., 2018 ). On the other hand, water governance is not synonymous with water management, which refers to operational activities (i.e., delivery, wastewater management, recycling) (Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ), but also entails the definition of priorities, which institutional arrangement is most suitable to satisfy them and the sharing of responsibilities among the various actors involved in the processes (Homsy and Warner, 2020 ; Gupta and Pahl-Wostl, 2013 ). Governance for water sustainability has become even more essential due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has highlighted the limitations and difficulties of water management worldwide. Recent data (OECD, 2020 ; IFC, 2020 ) evidence that the lack of access to a reliable water supply for a quarter of the world's population (UN, 2019 ) has made frequent and proper handwashing impossible, even though it is considered a basic frontline defence against the spread of the pandemic. Several governments across the globe have adopted crisis emergency measures, such as the suspension of water billing for low-income users and moratoriums on water service cut-offs, to help address the pandemic (Homsy and Warner, 2020 ). These measures have led to revenue losses for water utilities, which in the medium term could lead to a decline in capital investments in water utility infrastructures, with a consequent delay in meeting the SDG6 targets (Mukherjee et al., 2020 ). International organizations (i.e., OECD, the UN, World Bank, Global Water Intelligence) have called for all governments and institutions to build resilient infrastructures, management, and governance to prepare for future pandemics. The literature has identified various analytical perspectives to achieve the SDG#6 target.2  2 For more details about the SDG#6 target, please see https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6 .   Some researchers have identified the need to include sustainability goals in national legislation (Nshimbi, 2019 ; Zhang, 2016 ; Rossi, 2015 ); while others have analyzed the decision-making process to improve resource allocation (Adshead et al., 2019 ; Cetinkaya and Gunacti, 2018 ). Additionally, some scholars have identified technical solutions to meet sustainable targets (Weise et al., 2020 ; Truslove et al., 2019 ; Cetinkaya et al., 2018 ; Chaudhuri and Roy, 2017 ; Hadjimichael, 2016 ); while others have focused on performance indicators (Wright-Contreras et al., 2019 ; Wendling, 2018 ; Malik et al., 2015 ; Vilanova et al., 2015 ). Finally, some researchers have investigated the interlinking synergies or trade-offs among the SDGs (Alcamo, 2019 ; Nilsson et al., 2018 ; Griggs et al., 2014 ) and the nexus between energy and water (Macharia et al., 2020 ; Olawuyi D., 2020 ; Sharma and Kumar, 2020 ). Hence, although the literature has focused on the key dimensions of water sustainability governance, it still lacks an analysis of the leading practices adopted in operational contexts. This study draws on a broad review to identify the main dimensions for a “good and resilient” water governance model to meet SDG#6. Specifically, the following research questions are discussed:− RQ1: How have water sustainability issues been analyzed by researchers?  − RQ2: How can water governance be improved to meet SDG#6, especially in uncertain conditions?    This paper offers a comprehensive review of the literature on water governance models and SDGs, mostly SDG#6, following the resilience theory approach. The article analyzes the leading scientific papers collected from the main research databases, Web of Science (WoS) and Google Scholars (GS), producing a final database consisting of 118 publications in the English language, with publication dates from 2015 to 2020. The selected articles were subjected to a bibliometric analysis to highlight the correlation among the topics here proposed. This article is organized as follows: Section 2  describes the water sector regulatory framework, while Section 3  provides an overview of the theoretical framework. Section 4  illustrates the methodology used. Section 5  analyzes the findings, while Section 6  discusses the results. Finally, Section 7  draws conclusions and suggests future lines of research.  2 Theoretical background on water governance Since the 1977 UN water conference in Mar del Plata (Argentina), governments, policymakers, and multinational organizations have been wondering which governance solutions they should adopt to achieve sustainability goals. Pollit and Hupe (2011)  define sustainability as “magic” concepts that are easier to understand than define. In the literature, many definitions exist, and these are often very similar. One of the most quoted definitions is contained in the Brundtland report that defined sustainability as the “development that meets the needs of the present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (Brundtland, 1987 ). This definition has had many applications, including that proposed by Elkington, known as the Triple Bottom Line Approach (TBL), which argues that “sustainable development involves the simultaneous pursuit of economic prosperity, environmental quality, and social equity” (Elkington, 1998 ). This framework has been used in several studies to measure the impact of any activity on the three dimensions, thus identifying ‘ideal solutions’ that can ensure benefits on all dimensions in the long term. Specifically, referring to the water sector, May (2006: 4) defined sustainability as “the ability to provide and manage water quantity to meet the present needs of humans and environmental ecosystems, while not impairing the needs of future generations to do the same”. The definition of water sustainability requires that any water-related decision-maker or stakeholder consider the impact of their strategies, actions and practices on both present and future generations. Although it has long been the aim of the international political agenda (such as the Paris Agreement, World Water Forum, and Millennium Development Goals) to define goals, targets and deadlines, continuous growth in the population, urbanization and pollution, as well as climatic disasters due to global warming (such as droughts, groundwater depletion, and rising flood risks) make the search for responsible, sustainable and resilient models of water use an ongoing challenge. In the water sustainability challenge, governance plays a crucial role (OECD, 2015 ; UNEP, 2012 , 2011 ; Global Water Partnership, 2002 ). As the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) (2006: 1) stated: “the water crisis is largely a crisis of governance”, and good governance is essential for the effective long-term management of water resources. Despite this, water governance still does not have a univocal definition. In 1997 the United Nations Procurement Division (UNPD) defined governance as “the exercise of political, economic and administrative authority in the management of a country's affairs at all levels. Governance comprises the complex mechanisms, processes, and institutions through which citizens and groups articulate their interests, mediate their differences, and exercise their legal rights and obligations”. However, this statement does not specify which institutional arrangements can enable the achievement of the defined objectives and targets or which decision-making mechanisms can help achieve the defined strategies. Graham et al. (2003)  provided an alternative definition of governance as “the interactions among structures, processes and traditions that determine how power and responsibilities are exercised, how decisions are taken, and how citizens or other stakeholders have their say”. According to several scholars (Homsy and Warner, 2020 ; Jimenez et al., 2020 ; Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ; Anoyke, 2013; Gupta and Pahl-Wostl, 2013 ), the complexity of governance calls for a multilevel approach that requires us to move from hierarchic and state-centric models or market-driven solutions to more distributed governance, where state, local governments, private businesses, civil society and other organisms share roles and responsibilities. Thus, it is more apparent than ever that an effective and sustainable water governance system is a challenge that cannot be addressed by a single actor alone. Therefore, “the challenge remains to assess what should be governed at which level and what kind of cross-level coordination is required to achieve sustainable management” (Gupta and Pahl-Wostl, 2013 ). Academics and practitioners agree that this entails the participation of many actors - including the state and its community of reference - and strongly depends on contextual factors, such as economic, cultural and political norms, as well as the behavior of legislators and governments in each country. Gupta and Pahl-Wostl's (2013)  argument that ‘the policy context determines how society uses its water and which services it prioritizes’ implies that it is impossible to define an ideal model of governance for all countries since the evolution of political norms makes governance a dynamic concept that evolves and differs from one country to another (Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ; Guimarães et al., 2016 ). Indeed, as research has highlighted (Jimenez et al., 2020 ; Martinez-Cordoba et al., 2020 ; Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ; Peters, 2011 ; Ashworth et al., 2009 ), there is no ‘one size fits all solution’ for public services, because contingent factors (e.g., cultural, socio-economic, geographical, historical) influence the effectiveness of proposed solutions, and the degree and the way these are implemented by local institutions. These empirical studies show that the same strategy, institutional arrangement and technical solution or tariff setting model, applied in two different contexts, produce different outcomes. In this context, institutional theory may make a significant contribution. Scholars have shown that neo-institutionalism is one of the leading theoretical frameworks that help make sense of water institutional arrangements, while the operationalization of IWRM is linked to the history of water institutions in terms of past choices, public policy and governance trajectories (Hassenforder and Barone, 2018 ). The institutional design is potentially fallacious when context and determinism are not considered (Saunders, 2014 ; Lejano and Shankar, 2012 ; Merrey et al., 2007 ). Water sustainability is under threat by five contextual factors: climatic disasters, such as flood and droughts, mainly caused by global warming; demographic growth; rapid urbanization; the emergence of megacities that require the expansion of water and sanitation services; and ageing infrastructures. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the strong context-dependence of the water sector since the lack of household drinking water and sanitation services in developing countries, and the impossibility of applying social distancing measures in communities that share wells and water tanks represented serious threats for people's health (OECD, 2020 ). The pandemic has heightened awareness of the consequences of this access gap, pushing the international community to promote cooperation projects to build new infrastructures and economic measures to support the low-income population. These developments have prompted the United Nations, on the one hand, to review the 2030 SDG targets and, on the other, to call on governments to adopt a resilient approach to external changes. In fact, since the beginning of the crisis, the EU has indicated through its Strategic Foresight Report (2020) that the objective of policies in the wake of COVID-19 had to be the building of a more sustainable, resilient and fairer Europe. The concept of resilience, which was first developed in Ecosystem theory, has now become part of a multidisciplinary challenge aimed at encouraging the efficiency and sustainability of systems and communities in the context of instability (Medd and Chappells, 2007 ). Recently international organizations (e.g., the World Health Organization, United Nations, International Finance Corporation, 2020 ) underlined the importance of adopting a resilient approach for a sustainable future; in particular, the Global Commission on Adaptation (2019) has highlighted the need to adopt a resilient approach for speeding up climate change action in the water sectors. Additionally, the UN 2030 Agenda included resilience among the attributes required to achieve SDGs targets, stating similarly to the EU that ‘a sustainable, resilient and inclusive society’ is needed (UN, 2019 ; OECD, 2020 ; IFC, 2020 ). Rodina (2019)  defines resilience “as the ability of systems (social or biophysical) to withstand or cope with risks, shocks or stressors (be they climate change impacts, social crises, economic shocks or catastrophic events) while continuing to maintain certain key functions or structures”. As applied to water resource governance, resilience is considered a response to climate change and disasters that translates into greater levels of flexibility of institutions and infrastructure to overcome adverse events and ensure water supply and quality (Rodina, 2019 ; White, 2010 ). Resilience does not depend only on infrastructures performance but also on how institutional decisions are adopted locally and at higher levels (Smith et al., 2019 ). “Climate resilience and water management [are] needed to ensure that supply and storage solutions, institution and decision-making are matched to a shifting climate and a dynamic [and] uncertain water cycle” (Cooper, 2020 ). Good and resilient water governance should ensure access to quality drinking water and sanitation services to address future pandemic events. In sum, organizations need to acquire a resilient approach, which means the ability to understand that external conditions are changing and learn, self-organize, and respond quickly (Arnold et al., 2017 ). Local governments (LGs) play a critical role in this challenge since they have to decide which water governance model is most suitable to ensure access to safe drinking water and sanitation for a specific population and to modify their approach when external or internal conditions change (Sowby, 2020 ; Van Breda, 2001 ). According to Homsy and Warner (2020) , LGs have the aptitude for developing socio-environmental sustainability policies that adhere to community values and can mitigate the flaws in local systems and improve their resilience in the long term (Neal, 2020 ). Thus, to meet SDG#6, it seems essential to identify the characteristics water governance should have to be sustainable and resilient and how this can be translated into practice to enhance water resource management at the local level.  3 Water institutional arrangements: an overview Managing water services is a complex process that entails several activities and functions performed by different institutions. Most of the focus is on urban water services that include supply, sewerage, treatment and sanitation, but the water cycle begins with the abstraction and purification of the water that must be conveyed into the aqueduct, which in turn must be designed, built and managed. Besides drinking and household needs, water has other uses such as recreation, industry and commerce, agriculture, and thermoelectricity/energy. Strategies should consider all of these water uses contemporaneously to achieve SDG6 targets, which defining of policies to the financing of infrastructures, to identifying providers, to monitoring and controlling the provision of services, by numerous public and non-public entities, whose actions should be directed towards the achievement of a common goal. The definition of which institutional arrangements can enable the achievement of SDGs is a governance task. As stated above, its effectiveness strongly depends on historical, geographical, cultural, and economic factors. Water governance across the world is multilevel, where services are provided by various actors and responsibilities shared at national, regional and local levels. Policy context, including geographic location, the physical availability of water, socio-economic issues and norms, determine how water services are prioritized and provided to a particular population (Gupta and Pahl-Wostl, 2013 ), leading to different governance models. As Guimarães et al. (2016)  emphasize: “countries deal differently with the universal access to drinking water and sanitation services.” In many developing countries located in Asia, Africa or Latin America, access to water services is severely threatened by the lack of resources and infrastructures. In several European countries, such as Italy, France and the Netherlands, the right to access water services has been legally established by parliament. In other European countries (Wackerbauer, 2008 ), but also in the United States (Homsy and Warner, 2020 ), the choice about the mechanisms to guarantee this right is left to governments, mostly local, which seek their own balance between funding (provision) and investment (Guimarães et al., 2016 ). In the European context, scholars and policymakers have identified many characteristics of “good governance”, such as active citizenship, a culture of dialogue and negotiation (Castro, 2007 ). Currently, among European countries, it is possible to find a combination of hierarchical structures and market mechanisms, a mix of rules, norms, and institutions, and participatory mechanisms and partnerships. While Europe is generally characterized by a high percentage of the population having access to safe water and sanitation services, there are some countries (e.g., Italy and Greece) where old infrastructure and low levels of investment reduce the quality and sustainability of services due to frequent interruptions, high water loss and inadequate wastewater treatment; with the consequent application of EU sanctions (Guerrini et al., 2018 ) when the minimum standards are not respected. Every type of service delivery model can be found among the European countries; almost all infrastructures are owned by LGs that can decide to partially or entirely contract out water service delivery to private operators (EurEau, 2018 ). Local governments are generally considered to be the best at dealing with local communities needs and problems; thus, water infrastructures are commonly managed, and water services provided at this level in extra-EU countries (Homsy and Warner, 2020 ; Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ; Higuerey et al., 2017 ; Guimaraes et al., 2016 ; Ostrom, 1990 ). On the other hand, national governments are involved in policymaking to manage national and transboundary resources. In several countries, they also have the task of approving tariffs, determining the quality of service as well as establishing and enforcing environmental and health standards (Gupta and Pahl-Wostl, 2013 ). As a result, water tariffs contribute to recovering the costs almost everywhere in Europe, while in some countries, costs are still covered by a mix of tariffs, transfers and taxes (the ‘3 Ts’). The tariff structure differs from one country to another, but in most cases, the tariff comprises a fixed cost and a volumetric component. A water operator usually proposes a tariff to an authority (municipal, regional government or regional regulator, national ministry or independent national regulator) for approval, and in some cases, supervisory bodies ex-post check the tariffs (EurEau, 2018 ). The monitoring of drinking water quality is generally entrusted to health authorities (the Ministry of Health and their regional/local bodies). The protection of water resources and the establishment of environmental standards are usually the responsibility of the Ministry of the Environment or regional authorities and national environmental agencies. In many countries (e.g., in Africa, Asia, North America, and Europe), river basin organizations (RBOs) play a crucial role in governing international watercourses by establishing financing, decision-making and environmental monitoring mechanisms. Finally, at the global level, the UN, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and multinational organizations (e.g., OECD) define guidelines, goals and targets for sustainable development (Gupta and Pahl-Wostl, 2013 ). How each of these actors works with each other, the degree of citizen participation and the sharing of information, strategies and decision-making processes help determine good or bad water governance.  4 Methodology This research employed a qualitative method based on a systematic literature review to establish and systematize scholars' primary research orientation to identify existing gaps. The sample articles were collected through a detailed analysis of the ISI Web of Science (WoS), which is considered to be a database analogous to Scopus from the quantitative point of view but characterized by a standard format that limits, and perhaps even ‘removes the need for’ data cleansing (Zupic and Čater, 2015 ). Our research included two macro-phases: the first involved searching WoS based on the analysis of citations in high-level journals (Rashman et al., 2009 ). We also investigated the website of those journals known to publish theoretical and empirical studies on this topic, such as Utilities Policy; Journal of Cleaner Production; Water; Sustainability;  and the International Journal of Sustainable Development . In this first phase, we followed three steps. The first consisted of extracting all contributions and the study of relevant articles. The following keywords were selected: “water governance”, “water utilities”, “urban water management”, “integrated water resource management”, “SDG”, “sustainable development goals”, “2030 Agenda”, and “business models”. In order to include all articles published on this topic, these words were also combined in different ways. We excluded editorial material and duplicate papers. Next, we extended our research to relevant articles not included in WoS but published in non-indexed journals, using keyword combinations to search for articles on Google Scholar manually [insert Fig. 1   here]. At this stage, we also applied a time parameter to gather all papers published in the English language from 2015 (when the UN, 2030 Agenda was definitively approved) to September 2020. Secondly, we analyzed the content of each document by examining the keywords and reading the abstracts to include only articles relevant to the topic of investigation. After eliminating irrelevant articles and duplicate papers, we obtained a final database of 99 articles. At this moment, we collectively decided the criteria to follow for the analysis of papers, and a grid with all the key points relating to the research objectives was compiled. Finally, each author examined the papers assigned independently and then compared the results. The selected papers were classified into six different clusters, according to the analytical perspective researchers adopted and the key variables employed in their study, as follows: governance, management, normative, technical solutions, interlinkages, resilience. This clusterization process allowed us to understand the interest of scholars regarding the different segments of the investigated topic, according to the following items: a) year; b) authors; c) journal; d) article type; e) aims and findings; f) cluster topic; g) methodology. We summarize these results in Table 1  (see the Appendix). In the third phase of our study, we integrated the results of our research, comparing the implications of these results in an uncertain context. Specifically, we analyzed the sustainable governance behavior of a primary good, such as water, in situations of corruption or pandemics, such as COVID-19. Therefore, to identify the appropriate documents for a comparative analysis with the data collected from the WoS, we used the following search strings, without imposing time limits on the research, to include the greatest number of contributions: Group 1 : Resilience Theory and Corporate Governance; Group 2 : Resilience Theory and Corporate Governance and Pandemic; Group 3 : Resilience Theory and Corporate Governance and Pandemic and Corruption; Group 4 : Resilience Theory and Corporate Governance and Pandemic and Corruption in Public Utilities. For each manuscript, content analysis was performed by reading the title and abstract to include relevant articles describing the attributes of governance for resilience, capable of ensuring the continuity of public utilities in the context of crisis. This search returned 19 articles, for a total of 118 articles examined. This study allows practitioners and scholars to gain valuable insights. Nevertheless, it also has limitations because it is based on a structured literature review of 118 articles that we selected based on shared criteria detailed in the methodology. As a result, specific items may have been missed during the screening phase. In addition, this study exclusively considers the perspective of SDGs, while other contributions that adopt a broader sustainability perspective might arrive at other conclusions.  5 Findings The second phase of this research consisted of a qualitative analysis of selected articles: Appendix I  summarizes the results of our analysis. The analysis of findings highlights the multilevel complexity of the water sustainability challenge, which requires a multitude of technical, management and governance tools. From an in-depth analysis, it emerged that studies could substantially be split into two main groups: those focusing on supply (Adams and Vasquez, 2019 ; Egan and Agyemang, 2019 ; Kooy and Walter, 2019 ; Wright-Contreras et al., 2019 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ) and those on-demand (Adams and Vasquez, 2019 ; Horne, 2019 ; Fan et al., 2019 ); while a few focus on both (Kherbache, 2020 ; O'Donnell and Garrick, 2019 ; Calabrese et al., 2019 ; Barraque et al., 2017 ). Several researchers have established the need for a transition from supply-side water resource management to demand-side management (Kherbache, 2020 ; Horne, 2019 ; Fan et al., 2019 ) since great efforts in constructing infrastructures risk being lost due to the poor use of resources or under-utilization of capacities in hydraulic equipment. Today's strategies for reducing water demand sit alongside those for increasing water supply since the ‘sustainability challenge’ cannot be ‘won’ by following a single-sided approach. The objective of the demand side approach is to reduce water demand and environmental impact by offering alternative sources and optimal solutions within the urban water systems (Fan et al., 2019 ). The increasingly frequent occurrence of climate disasters that seriously threaten access to water and sanitation services, especially in developing countries, led many researchers (Delanka et al., 2020 ; Weise et al., 2020 ; Adshead et al., 2019 ; Calabrese et al., 2019 ; Malik et al., 2015 ; Mycoo, 2018 ; Hadjimichael et al., 2016 ) to highlight the importance of identifying the characteristics, occurrence and impacts of these events, and to propose technical solutions to predict, prevent and deal with the consequences. Data gaps on water infrastructure conditions represent a limitation to decision-making processes, timely interventions and investment planning to reduce water losses and improve water quality services. Specifically, in the water sector, artificial intelligence applications have been widely used to model, optimize or data mine for knowledge generation (Hadjimichael et al., 2016 ). Artificial neural networks (Hadjimichael et al., 2016 ), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Calabrese et al., 2019 ) and Satellite-based Wetland Observation Service (SWOS) (Weise et al., 2020 ) emerge as the most frequent solutions adopted in the water sector, followed by clustering. These advanced technological systems are used to identify water losses and monitor territorial areas and, together with the development of metrics, to assess the performance of infrastructure-linked targets and the quantification of future infrastructure investments (Delanka et al., 2020 ; Adshead et al., 2019 ; Malik et al., 2015 ). However, the technical solutions, as evidenced by Romano and Akhmouch (2019)  in their analysis of the OECD Water Governance Assessment Framework, “represent only part of the solution for cities to manage water in a sustainable, integrated and inclusive way, at an acceptable cost, and in a reasonable timeframe”. Some scholars of SDG#6 (Macharia et al., 2020 ; Laspidou et al., 2020 ; Sharma and Kumar, 2020 ; van Zanten and van Tulder, 2020 ; R.G. Lawford, 2019a , 2019b ) have focused on analyzing the water-energy nexus and other links among the SDGs, upon which the success of the UN 2030 Agenda depends. The aim is to optimize positive relationships between SDGs and minimize the negative “to create co-benefits and reduce possible trade-offs” (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2020 ). The issue of interlinkages has been investigated from a technical and normative perspective because policies, strategies, regulations, technical solutions, and managerial practices that ignore interactions between individual economic activities and the three pillars of sustainable development risk producing operational bottlenecks that hinder the achievement of SDGs (Oloawi, 2020). However, the need for this integrated approach has still not emerged from the analysis of SDG#6 targets and indicators, among which the need to “implement integrated water resources management (IWRM) at all levels” (Target 6.5) is still predominant. From the analysis of some contributions (Benson et al., 2020 ; Nshimbi, 2019 ; Hussein et al., 2018 ; Bertule et al., 2018 ; Hussein et al., 2018 , 2018bib_Hussein_et_al_2018 ), it can be established that the degree of IWRM is considered key to measuring SDG#6 achievement. However, this focus on measuring IWRM implementation through institutional indicators also has its critics (Benson et al., 2020 ; Hussein et al., 2018 ); since its effectiveness is unclear and ignores existing links to other SDGs. Bertule et al. (2018)  propose seven core principles, or dimensions, for more objective IWRM measurement following the adoption of the UN 2030 Agenda: integration; scale; institutions; participation; economic valuation; equity; and environmental/ecological protection. They emphasize that water governance assessment must not ignore “regulatory frameworks that could enable and foster more sustainable, equitable and inclusive water governance”. However, from the analysis of our findings, it emerges that good water governance requires the strengthening of policy, institutional and regulatory frameworks, which is currently both fragmented and distant from the “inclusive and holistic” approach that water security and access require (Joshi and Nicol, 2020 ). Several researchers, in line with UN 2030 Agenda principles, have pointed out that in order to achieve SDG#6 a mix of coordinated and harmonized policies involving cooperation and collaboration among a variety of actors are needed (Adams and Vasquez, 2019 ; Cisneros, 2019 ; Nshimbi, 2019 ; Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ; Bertule et al., 2018 ). They also underline the need to engage citizens, as well as all the other stakeholders, in participative dialogue. Some of these contributions developed specific frameworks containing principles for effective water governance assessment, such as Jimenez et al. (2020) , who “identify the core components of water governance (functions), their potential qualities when performed (attributes), and how they interrelate with the values and aspirations of the different stakeholders to achieve certain outcomes”. In order to address RQ2, we identify the key elements that water governance needs to be sustainable and resilient. These refer mainly to the ways actors should act and interact to achieve the common goal of ensuring water access and sanitation services for all. In sum, our literature review suggests that actors should coordinate their actions and cooperate and collaborate for sustainable water governance. Specifically, scholars have identified Coordination  as an essential element of good governance (Sharma and Kumar, 2020 ; Herrera, 2019 ; Horne, 2019 ; Nshimbi, 2019 ; Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ; Bertule, 2018 ); although they have approached it from different angles. For example, Jimenez et al. (2020)  and Bertule et al. (2018)  consider it to be a function of governance. It entails a series of mechanisms and tools through which some authorities and stakeholders can establish concerted action for water management and governance, thereby avoiding duplication. According to the normative perspective, coordination among the various levels of legislation is essential to avoid contrasting and contradictory rules that hinder the achievement of SDGs. Harmonization  of water policies and legislation is even more important for developing countries (Nshimbi, 2019 ), as ‘non-aid policies’ by donor countries can be harmful. OECD (2015 : 28) assigns this aim to policy coherence development, whose aim is “to ensure that the objectives and results of a government's (or institution's) development policy are not undermined by the other policies of that same government (or institution), which impact on developing countries, and that these other policies support development objectives where feasible”. It specifically refers to the need of governments at all levels to develop policies and enact legislation for water development and management that do not conflict or undermine other efforts. Cooperation  is another key element on which many scholars focus (Schreurs et al., 2018 ; Wiegleb and Bruns 2018 ), and it is one of the main innovations introduced by the UN 2030 Agenda. Wiegleb and Bruns (2018) , in their study on the shift from Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to SDGs, argued that SDG#6 merged the two areas of development cooperation and sustainable development policies. Innovative water management solutions, such as Nature Based Solutions (NBS) (Wendling et al., 2018 ) that aim to prevent the consequences of climatic disasters require cooperation among institutions and stakeholders, as well as local community participation. Collaboration  among stakeholders is essential for developing, managing, and using water resources “in an equitable, sustainable and efficient manner” (Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ; Bertule, 2018 ). Additionally, Cisneros (2019)  has underlined the importance of collaborative governance, as required by SDGs, to secure water for all by 2030. Our literature review reveals that the main mechanisms through which coordination and collaboration should operate to produce positive outcomes are stakeholder engagement  (Horne, 2019 ); stakeholder participation  (Benson et al., 2020 ; Hegga et al., 2020 ; Cisneros, 2019 ; Herrera, 2019 ; Schreurs et al., 2018 ) and multi-stakeholder dialogue  (Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ; Barraque et al., 2017 ). These are considered to be essential for the effective and efficient functioning of water management and governance. Hegga et al. (2020)  argue that the entire process can become ineffective if governments fail to support and allow local actors to participate positively in the governance system. Multi-stakeholder dialogues on how to share responsibilities and how to achieve desired outcomes are essential for managing the water sector (Ahmed and Araral, 2019 ; Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ; Barraque et al., 2017 ), but require transparency , accountability  and participation  principles (Schreurs et al., 2018 ). However, the literature (e.g., Ahmed and Araral, 2019 ; Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ) provides evidence that political, social, and economic factors inﬂuence governance, as well as the effectiveness of any solution, whether technical or managerial, introduced to improve water sustainability. This analysis confirms the impossibility of identifying ‘one size fits all solutions’ or for LGs to find a single ‘best solution’, as the context in which each governs differs. Thus, the issue becomes how LGs can embed global goals in local policy and ensure that sustainable water governance is reflected in their strategies, policies, decision-making processes and management practices. Several studies have sought to highlight the crucial role of LGs in achieving the UN 2030 Agenda since they “represent agents of change as they hold the key to activating citizen awareness, which is an essential element in achieving the SDGs”  (Martinez Cordoba et al., 2020 ).  Specifically, for the achievement of SDG#6, “ cities must ensure that the institutional frameworks in place are “fit to fix the pipes”, from accessible information to adequate capacity, from sufficient funding to transparency and integrity, and from meaningful stakeholder engagement to coherence across sectoral policies” (Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ). Additionally, the complexity of water governance can be increased by external factors such as climate change and other non-climatic stress factors that make the sustainability challenge even harder (Mycoo, 2018 ). Specifically, this challenge requires self-organising and adaptive strategies to face risks and threats from external change. This concept is what Jimenez et al. (2020)  call “adaptiveness” or “adaptation” (Glass and Newig, 2019 ; Akhter et al., 2010 ; Campbell, 2009 ; Medd and Chappells, 2007 ), but even more frequently, scholars describe it as “resilience”. It means that water governance requires, on the one hand, the adoption of complementary measures that are at the same time dynamic, ﬂexible and relevant to the conditions of each territorial area, as shown by Mycoo (2018)  in his study on Trinidad. On the other hand, the implementation of policies, practices and tools for good governance depends on “available ﬁnancial and skilled human resources, administrative reform across a multiplicity of agencies, robust enforcement of legislation and the use of innovative technological tools”. Furthermore, recently the journey towards sustainable governance has been slowed by the epidemiological catastrophe of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hit the whole world (Djalante et al., 2020 ). It has increased the need to investigate the management of uncertainties, which requires even more coordination and collaboration, plus a multi-stakeholder approach for risk containment, even though uncertainty is not measurable. Environmental disasters, armed conflicts, social unrest, corruption and pandemics represent a serious threat to good governance (Costantinos, 2014 ); nonetheless, there remain many limits to context assessments with respect to the effectiveness of the policies adopted, as well as the human and financial resources used in the development strategies (Ling et al., 2017 ; Parthasarathy, 2015 ). Our findings have also identified in the “theory of resilience” the theoretical framework that allows us to understand the functioning of governance mechanisms in the management of disasters to mitigate effects for both investors and employees (van Essen et al., 2015 ; Herbane, 2010 ; Akhter et al., 2010 ; Greene et al., 2004 ). Fig. 2   provides a “cloud” of the words used most frequently in the abstracts of the selected articles. This technique of “visualization” of the most recurrent information within one or more texts provides information on the relevance of a theme and its ability to interrelate with the connected topics (Heimerl et al., 2014 ). The frequency index can be understood from the dimension that the words assume in the graphic image, from which it is clear that “resilience” is the keyword of the studies that investigate the ability of organizations to adapt to the uncertainty of human and natural systems and is in the ‘center’ of the map. Beyond the meaning attributed by the literature to the concept of resilience, the word cloud represents an intuitive mode of synthesis of the topics examined, which leaves room for future insights (Heimerl et al., 2014 ). Fig. 2  shows that, in public utility services, the theme of resilience has been associated with the following words: “companies”, “food”, “regime”, and “authority”, signifying the importance of companies to adapt management services that affect social well-being. However, a resilient system can resist and react to turbulence and crisis factors while preserving the essence of its primary functions (Rodina, 2019 ). In particular, the concept of resilience that emerges from the data collection, applied to the governance systems of water resources, expresses the ability to react to climatic and socio-environmental phenomena, which compromise the ordinary management methods of services, infrastructures, supply and use of a precious commodity such as water (Sowby, 2020 ; Neal, 2020 ; Rodina, 2019 ; Arnold et al., 2017 ; White, 2010 ; Medd and Chappells, 2007 ; Van Breda, 2001 ). From the comparative analysis, we have constructed a conceptual map of the clusters according to the themes by presenting a correlation index of the studies on governance for resilience (Liu, 2004 ). In particular, by using a mechanism for identifying similarities (Van Eck and Waltman, 2014 ), we selected the most common keywords in the titles and abstracts of the selected papers. Subsequently, we identified the relationships between words based on their presence in two or more of the papers under study. As shown in Fig. 3  , the topics are united by more or less intense filaments to form four macro-groups: the RED group represents the orientation of governance and performance in the resilience framework; the second group in BLUE identifies the main issue related to business resilience, towards sustainable development; the ORANGE group includes the topics of corporate governance and entrepreneurship; while the fourth group in VIOLET describes the various mechanisms of corporate governance from an internal lens. This hierarchical diagram expresses the interrelationships between concepts, revealing how the topics are connected or contingent, making the study more efficient (Liu, 2004 ). The conceptual map illustrates that the four clusters are gathered within a concentric circle, which symbolizes the interconnection between the four macro themes: resilience, business, corporate behavior, and corporate governance. The risk and resilience approach of organizations contributes to positive business management, with significant impacts on the choices of shareholders and stakeholders, and influences the chain of governance (Apaydin et al., 2020 ; McKnight, 2019 ; Braun et al., 2017 ; Benton, 2016 ; Chrisman et al., 2011 ; Campbell, 2009 ; Whiteman et al., 2004 ). The theory of resilience was developed as a tool for “reducing the emphasis on pathology and increasing the emphasis on strengths” (Van Breda, 2001 ) and expresses the ability to adapt to stress factors, developing appropriate responses even in situations of uncertainty (Greene et al., 2004 ). In uncertainty contexts, the resilience of organizations supports the planning and governance systems to shape “adaptive subjects”, which can protect the system from external shocks (Welsh, 2014 ). These concerns apply to public utility management, such as health care (Ling et al., 2017 ) or the water sector (Akhter et al., 2010 ), with respect to which the adaptation processes or the conservation of system balance can have serious consequences for standards of social well-being, economic growth, political stability and democratic development (Duit and Galaz, 2008 ). COVID-19 has generated an unprecedented situation of uncertainty, which has put a strain on organizations and institutions worldwide and has highlighted the need for timely and strategic interventions to reduce risks from catastrophe (Cleland, 2020 ). Based on the commitments made for the UN 2030 Agenda, significant global financial investments and pledges have been made to support communities affected by the pandemic. However, very little has been done concerning the development of shared strategies and memoranda of understanding to address the uncertainties within corporate governance systems, which also affect performance (Djalante et al., 2020 ). Conversely, the results of our study suggest that the coordination of legislation in different countries, collaboration between parties, multilevel governance, and context assessment constitute the paradigm of effective water resource management to help achieve the SDG#6 objective.  6 Discussion Our findings highlight the fact that for years the debate on water sustainability has been dominated by contributions that seek to find technical solutions to achieving SDGs (Zhang et al., 2019 ; Cronk and Bartram, 2018 ; Chaudhuri and Roy, 2017 ; Hadjimichael, 2016 ); while only recently has attention been paid to governance (Breuer and Spring 2020 ; Jimenez et al., 2020 ; Glass and Newig, 2019 ) and management issues. We could not identify studies on water governance that establish new water governance sustainability models, but our literature review revealed some of the critical elements of sustainable governance, such as coordination (Martinez Cordoba et al., 2020 ; Sharma and Kuma, 2020 ; Herrera, 2019 ; Horne, 2019 ; Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ; Bertule, 2018 ), collaboration (Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ; Bertule, 2018 ), cooperation (Schreurs et al., 2018 ; Wiegleb and Bruns 2018 ), stakeholder engagement (Horne, 2019 ), stakeholder participation (Benson et al., 2020 ; Hegga et al., 2020 ; Cisneros, 2019 ; Herrera, 2019 ; Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ; Schreurs et al., 2018 ; Barraque et al., 2017 ), and adaptiveness (Jimenez et al., 2020 ; Glass and Newig, 2019 ; Akhter et al., 2010 ; Campbell, 2009 ; Medd and Chappells, 2007 ). Some of these features, like coordination, harmonization, cooperation and collaboration, include all the mechanisms and tools required in a network governance model (Gupta and Pahl-Wostl, 2013 ; Ostrom, 2010 ), where all the actors involved need to be in dialogue and coordinate their actions to achieve the common water sustainability goal. Guimarães et al. (2016)  highlighted how traditional mechanisms have failed to help resolve conflicts between network actors involved in water governance and the need to introduce innovative collaboration processes. The establishment of partnerships among water utilities, municipalities, community-based organizations, NGOs and public-private partnerships have significantly enhanced access to water services for low-income communities in developing countries, like Brazil, Senegal, South Africa, Argentina, and Chile; in fact, some researchers (Galvez et al., 2020 ; Guimarães et al., 2016 ) argue that a ‘collaboration paradigm’ is being developed. Collaboration requires the dissemination of sound governance principles, such as transparency, accountability, fairness and stakeholder participation (Jimenez et al., 2020 ; Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ) that both allow them to dialogue and actively participate in the achievement of this common goal and activate monitoring and control mechanisms involving all stakeholders. Mechanisms of social participation and control (such as involvement in planning and budgetary decisions and the communication of annual reports to stakeholders) are particularly relevant for essential services, like water, because they contribute to stakeholder engagement and social consensus. Although water governance involves governments at all levels, several studies (Homsy and Warner, 2020 ; Martinez Cordoba et al., 2020 ; Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ) have argued that LGs play a vital role in achieving SDG#6. Thus, LGs must raise sufficient funds to build and maintain resilient infrastructures to ensure quality drinking water and sanitation services, establish transparency mechanisms, and engage citizens and stakeholders in the decision-making process. However, in the articles analyzed, we could identify very few references to the institutional arrangements, ownership structures, control systems or tariff settings (one exception was Martinez-Cordoba et al., 2020 ), as if these were irrelevant for the achievement of SDG#6 targets. The establishment of rules, goals and targets, the definition of a strategy to pursue them, and the monitoring of outcomes, as well as the planning, financing, and management of resources are crucial for the good governance of water resources, and they should not, therefore, be considered separately from the SDG targets (Bel, 2020 ; Rodrigues and Tavares, 2017 ; Kim, 2018 ). Glass and Newig (2019) , for example, found that democratic institutions and participation can enhance SDG implementation and facilitate decision-making processes, as well as the implementation and acceptance of sustainable and transparency policies. Nevertheless, they found that only GDP per capita is statistically related to the achievement of the SDG#6 target. This result confirms the importance of establishing “adequate government funding” to achieve water security and sanitation targets. Context-specific factors can influence water allocation by introducing criteria that is not economically based (Woodhouse and Muller, 2017 ). LGs should be supported financially, as well as in decision-making processes, by the central government transferring essential knowledge, competencies, and technologies for the management and governance of water resources. In any case, the effectiveness of water governance depends on institutional factors, like territorial reforms or policy complementarities across sectors, levels of corruption and the willingness and preparedness of local institutions. Establishing a common governance framework is difficult since governance is, as many researchers have highlighted (Ahmed and Araral, 2019 ; Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ; Mycoo, 2018 ; Schwartz et al., 2018 ), essentially a matter of context. Furthermore, the goal of providing safe water for all is constantly under threat by the emergence of unpredictable events (Chrisman et al., 2011 ; Cleland, 2020 ; Sowby, 2020 ). The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fact that the water sector needs to enhance its resilience (Sowby, 2020 ) and establish sound governance mechanisms. Recent studies (IFC, 2020 ; OECD, 2020 ) have pointed out that the pandemic is severely affecting the budgets of water utilities due to the revenue losses caused by lockdowns and travel restrictions with the consequent decline of water demand from large industrial and commercial users and by exemptions, bill-deferring and moratoriums on cutting off water service for low-income households. In the long term, this practice could lead to a critical reduction of investments in infrastructure, worsening their condition and the gap in access to water and sanitation services. Central government transfers, possible tariff adjustments and financial aid to water utilities could help them face declining revenues and illiquidity, ensuring continuity of the service and avoiding significant setbacks in the UN 2030 Agenda. This solution would require strengthening coordination and collaboration governance mechanisms, which scholars have highlighted. As our analysis evidenced, the management of public services, such as water (Akhter et al., 2010 ), as well as services that affect social well-being, like food supply (see Fig. 2 ), requires the development of more adequate processes of adaptation to contingent factors, intending to ensure social welfare standards and economic growth (Duit and Galaz, 2008 ). Likewise, it also highlighted the lack of shared programs for socio-ecological resilience, as well as an aligned protocol for water management, capable of managing uncertainties within corporate governance systems, which affect performance, board composition, investment strategies, and supply chain (see Fig. 3 ). Research points to the need to strengthen partnerships between institutions and organizations to meet SDG#6. Hence, the spread of the pandemic - and the implications linked to the socio-economic emergency generated - marked a slowdown in the race towards meeting when facing the risk of uncertain and corrupt events, to develop governance solutions that adhere to the context, can mitigate the weaknesses of systems, through a collaborative approach towards the management of complex situations such as the pandemic crisis (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2020 ). Some scholars have highlighted the fact that during an uncertain period, such as a pandemic, stakeholder engagement, particularly public engagement, positively influences the accountability and decision-making processes, as well as societal cohesion, community concept and trust in the governance of the public administration (Manetti et al., 2017 ). These mechanisms might also help governments identify gaps in the service and failures and adopt appropriate solutions. In this same line, strong support could come from implementing automation and remote-control processes, which allow water infrastructures to be monitored and operated at a distance and to communicate with customers, respecting social-distancing protocols. Garrett et al. (2009)  claim that, in order to reduce chaos risk, engagement is important in the temporary measures that public administrations adopt in their anti-epidemic plans, which affect some community members more than others. For instance, during an uncertain period such as an epidemic, some researchers argue that citizens' compliance and cooperation in adopting recommended behaviors by health and government authorities are critical drivers in making public interventions effective (Landi et al., 2021 ; Han et al., 2020 ). On the other hand, stakeholder engagement requires integrated governance to coordinate governments and organizations towards resilient governance models (Neal, 2020 ). Citizen and community participation could enhance the monitoring of water resource use and development and support decision-making processes. Thus, the spread of COVID-19 has highlighted the vulnerabilities of water management systems, as well as the strategic role of LGs in the adoption of sustainable strategies, which are capable of reflecting the values and peculiarities of local contexts (Neal, 2020 ; Homsy and Warner, 2020 ). In response to climatic disasters and pandemic events, governments are employing innovative tools, such as wastewater reuse and Nature-Based Solutions, to restore the environment and prevent droughts and floods. These methods also include the realization of ‘sponge cities’, especially in China - that combine engineering solutions to store stormwater to use during extreme events; the combination of green and gray infrastructures to improve storage and supply and reduce costs; and performance enhancement to make water services more resilient; among many others. All these solutions require cooperation among multiple institutions and stakeholders (Browder et al., 2019 ) and strengthening forms of collaboration among the numerous private and public institutions involved in water governance.  7 Concluding remarks One of the biggest challenges facing local and central governments worldwide in the coming decades is to ensure access to water and provide quality water services to communities. Its relevance for the world has been emphasized by the UN, which gave it a specific goal within the UN 2030 Agenda, SDG#6, whose aim is to “ensure access to water and sanitation for all”. This literature review has revealed that, despite IWRM being one of the main targets of UN SDG#6, it can also be considered as part of the solution for water sustainability; if establishing “what-to-do”, “who does what” and “at which level of government” is important, so is defining “how” (Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ). All these questions pertain to water governance, which entails the distribution of roles and responsibilities among the large variety of actors involved in the water sector and requires a new perspective on how they should interact with each other to achieve SDGs. Previous studies have highlighted the need to move from hierarchical and market models to network governance based on cooperation among public, private and civil actors (Gupta and Pahl-Wostl, 2013 ; Ostrom, 2010 ). The specific changes required must be found within the boundaries of any single country because it is impossible - also for international organizations - to impose a single “good governance model” since it depends on the way local institutions and citizens act and interact with each other (Castro, 2007 ). However, the identification of guiding principles and key attributes for sound and sustainable water governance could help in this direction. In an era of climate change and increasing non-climatic stress events, such as the pandemic, technical solutions alone are insufficient. A blend of more effective policies, strategies, and managerial practices are needed to guarantee good governance of water resources to address the sustainability challenge. Good water governance will be needed to ensure global access to quality water and sanitation services to fight and prevent future pandemics. Our in-depth analysis of governance cluster contributions suggests that researchers have increasingly tried to define which attributes are essential for governance models to meet sustainability goals. Some scholars have identified coordination, cooperation, collaboration, policy harmonization and multi-stakeholder participation as the key elements to achieve sustainability targets. The critical role of LGs in translating these guiding principles into practice, taking into account context specificities, has also been stressed. In the implementation of global sustainability policies, LGs face several difficulties due to ‘internal gaps’, such as scarce technical and human resources, debt limits and fiscal constraints (Furlong, 2016 ), and ‘external gaps’, mainly consisting of institutional territorial reforms (Homsy and Warner, 2020 ; Martinez-Cordoba et al., 2020 ; Romano and Akhmouch, 2019 ). Thus, the responsibilities on how to manage water services to achieve SDG#6 is mainly in the hands of LGs. The choice of which actors to involve, the nature of the providers, the water pricing strategies, the contracts that govern the relationship between LGs and providers, the activities of controlling and measuring performance and the quality of the services delivered are crucial since ‘bad choices’ can compromise attempts to ensure universal access to water services. As evidenced by some scholars (Martinez-Cordoba et al., 2020 ), the “territorialization of SDGs” makes local governments essential to the effective implementation of Agenda (2030), including the mobilization of citizens and stakeholders. However, despite the number of contributions published on SDG#6, relatively little is known about how cities are planning, monitoring, and implementing global policy agendas at the local level. In sum, what is clear is that multilevel, shared and participative governance is required (Homsy and Warner, 2020 ; Gupta and Pahl-Wostl, 2013 ) since water services involve a variety of actors and the sustainability challenge cannot ‘be won’ by LGs alone. At the same time, these “principles” need to be operationalized through “actionable management instruments at appropriate levels”. Moreover, in the presence of uncertain events, including the pandemic, the study revealed that the governance of a primary good, such as water, requires not only the sharing of “holistic” knowledge of processes and regulations but also the adoption of a multidisciplinary approach, aimed at understanding the ‘resilience strategies’ to adopt. It is not easy to understand the impact of SDGs on paradigm shifts in water governance since, as shown by Breuer and Spring (2020) , change can be driven by domestic events and local opportunities and heavily depends on political will at the highest level. This study has demonstrated that context severely conditions the effectiveness of governance and management solutions. It is impossible to define a single governance model, but these models have to accurately and rapidly adapt to a changing context. In this sense, SDGs have limitations that reduce their potential for monitoring, supporting, and achieving sustainability (Eisenmenger et al., 2020 ). The achievement of the UN 2030 Agenda will principally rely on those actors responsible for unsustainable resource use, and the implementation of measures strongly depends on political will and the contexts where these are introduced. However, if their transformative potential is limited in practice, the strategic relevance of SDGs for shaping future scenarios and the identification of good practices cannot be neglected. 7.1 Theoretical and practical implications of the study This article clarifies existing research into water governance and the UN 2030 Agenda and contributes both to academia and practice in several ways. First, the structured literature review contributes to academic knowledge by identifying a literature gap concerning which governance models can enable countries to achieve the Agenda. Previous studies have established the impossibility of defining a ‘one size fits all’ solution since governance heavily depends on contextual factors. At the same time, as this study shows, the definition of which guiding principles to follow and which attributes water governance needs to embed to be sustainable and resilient could help governments and practitioners to achieve SDGs. This process is still ongoing, as our content analysis of the numerous contributions shows. The ways these general principles and attributes can be put into practice by LGs are still under investigation in the academic literature, opening up opportunities for future research. From a practical perspective, this study sheds lights on the need for LGs to implement effective tools to coordinate local decisions with global policies. The implementation of digital technologies, like digital platforms, might support multi-level water governance among all the actors and institutions involved, allowing constant monitoring of local problems (i.e., flood and droughts, inadequate infrastructures, water leakages, and so on). It might also allow effective coordination of strategies, decision–making processes and outcomes towards SDG#6. Consistent monitoring and control would facilitate the intervention and timely support of water-related institutions, along with specific financing programs addressed at restoring infrastructures. This approach would allow sharing responsibilities among all actors in the water “value chain” and strengthen governance resilience. Furthermore, to enable broad citizen participation and raise their awareness about the responsible use of water resources, LGs should improve their communication, transform it from one-way to two-way communication, and allow citizens to participate actively in decision-making processes. LGs should also organize educational programs [NOTE: this is the US spelling] for citizens, starting in primary schools. These actions have proved to be particularly important during the pandemic. For example, in Southeast Asia, the Fit for School (FIT) program supported national and local governments to develop national standards and implement guidelines for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in schools (UN, 2020 ). Finally, to afford investments in infrastructure and reduce wastewater LGs may increase tariffs or taxes associated with higher consumption. LGs’ budgetary issues in the water sector, however, include the need to balance affordability, equity and sustainability.  7.2 Policy recommendation This study highlights the need to establish clear guidelines for LGs on how to manage and govern water services to meet SDG#6 targets, as the risk of LGs implementing ineffective solutions is too high. Specifically, our findings suggest that water needs to be managed at the appropriate scale, within integrated basins, but considering local conditions. The presence of various actors sharing different roles and responsibilities calls for policy coherence, coordination, and collaboration mechanisms to avoid competing measures and possible conflicts. Transparency, accountability, and engagement should be promoted to allow the contributions of as many stakeholders as possible in water policy design and implementation. Enhanced participation processes would improve decision-making and the sharing of shared values and strategies. Improved processes support resilience by enabling institutions and actors to adapt their policies to external changes and unpredictable events. This study also highlights the need to establish governance mechanisms that could be useful in helping the government gather and allocate financial resources efficiently since poor investment in infrastructures and reduced revenues due to low tariffs continue to represent a major obstacle to the achievement of SDGs.
