                  This study was conducted to investigate how the legal framework governing the Bangladeshi fishery sector can be reformed through measures such as governance reform, increasing coordination between administrative bodies and educating key stakeholders, including fishermen. In doing so, this paper evaluates how Bangladeshi fishery laws can facilitate sustainable development and improved environmental outcomes for coastal and marine living resources. This study also examined how non-compliance with the legal framework could negatively affect government initiatives to achieve Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 14. To collect empirical data, fieldwork was conducted at two sites in the coastal zone of Bangladesh and was supplemented by a review of the secondary literature on legal documents. The key findings show that despite the strong existing legal mechanisms, non-compliance with regulations is widespread and has resulted in severe degradation of coastal and marine living resources. Thus, the unsustainable exploitation of resources is restricting the ability to achieve the targets of SDG 14, such as eliminating IUU fishing and providing access to small-scale fisheries. After examining the issues that cause non-compliance, this study provides guidelines for the development and effective implementation of legal and policy frameworks to ensure sustainable coastal and marine living resource management in Bangladesh.

Keywords Legal framework  Bay of Bengal  Marine living resources management  SDGs  Blue Economy    1 Introduction Bangladesh has a maritime zone of 118,813 sq. km in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) [1] , including the 200-nautical mile (nm) Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and 354 nm of continental shelf [2] . Despite the large number of marine fish species (511, including shrimp) [3] , the contribution of marine fisheries to the total national catch is quite low. For example, in 2014-15, only 16.28% of the total national fish production was of marine origin [4] . Nevertheless, the coastal and marine fishery sector is very important as it provides livelihood opportunities to millions of poor coastal people, and contributes to national food and nutrition security [5,6] . This sector faces several challenges. The marine fisheries of Bangladesh are vulnerable to collapse because the catch per unit fishing is decreasing due to declining fish and shrimp stocks [7] . The major drivers of coastal and marine resource degradation include noncompliance with fishing rules and regulations by the stakeholders by applying increased fishing pressure, including the use of destructive fishing methods and gears [8–10] . A tendency to fish for whatever is available, including larvae and juveniles, is also a common practice. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure a sustainable catch from the sea; thus, it is important to amend the existing laws and ensure their proper implementation. There is no individual act on coastal fisheries; rather, it is controlled by general national fishery laws, rules, and policies. The national laws provide guidelines for the conservation, management, and development of marine fisheries resources. Bangladesh has also agreed, endorsed or ratified a number of legal and policy frameworks. These frameworks include different conventions, declarations, and agreements covering international marine and coastal environmental sectors, including the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC); United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED); International Maritime Organization conventions (IMO); and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The present analysis focuses only on the national legal framework of Bangladesh. There are numerous laws and regulations that provide policy and regulatory frameworks for the management of marine living resources. These laws are, however, not enforced properly for multiple reasons. The immediate consequences of this non-compliance include the degradation of fisheries’ resources (through destructive fishing practices) and reduced human well-being (fishers face persecution and penalties for the violation of laws and regulations) [6] . Therefore, a sound management system is necessary to measure the extent and patterns of non-compliance and to explore ways to secure compliance. This is emphasized in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be attained by 2030. The SDGs specifically target effective regulation of harvesting, including elimination of overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and destructive fishing practices. The implementation of science-based management plans will be crucial step in the attainment of these goals. Therefore, the formulation of a proper legal and policy framework for the utilization and conservation of living resources in its marine waters is indispensable. Thus, identifying the knowledge gaps in fishery regulations and fishers’ responses to regulation is also necessary. The present study is a contribution to filling these knowledge gaps. The purpose is to assess how the legal framework governing the Bangladeshi fishery sector can be improved through measures such as governance reform, increasing coordination between administrative bodies and education of key stakeholders, including fishermen. In doing so, this paper evaluates how Bangladeshi fishery laws can facilitate sustainable development and improve environmental outcomes for coastal areas. The following section reviews the international literature to build a theoretical framework on the role of the legal framework for fishery management and its links to achieving Sustainable Development Goals. The methodology section discusses data sources, methods of data collection and data analysis, the selection of interviewees and selection of questions for semi-structured interviews. The next section presents the results of the assessment of legal frameworks and the respondents’ perceptions regarding reforming the fisheries’ legal framework. The discussion section then follows, and the paper concludes with final remarks regarding policy implications.  2 The role of legal frameworks in fisheries management During the last century, a new understanding of how human behaviour created adverse environmental effects has developed. This information has challenged the efficacy of existing legal frameworks in addressing the sustainability issues of the environment. Environmental law has evolved into a specialized field of law, in which hundreds of national regulations in many countries, as well as international environmental treaties, were created only in the last half century [11] . However, many of these legal regulations have failed to provide adequate protection for the environment and failed to create conditions that promote sustainable utilization of common-pool resources [12] . Nevertheless, the legal framework is instrumental in the management of natural resources. Legal rules provide rights, obligations, and responsibilities for the communities involved. These also define what is permitted, who has the power to do what, and the consequences of different acts, omissions, and situations. Moreover, in large-scale situations and transboundary contexts, legal structures are also crucial for determining who may make binding decisions on the content and application of general norms in different jurisdictions. The laws also provide legitimacy for the decision-making power of communities in community-based resource management. In addition to regulating the natural system, legal frameworks also address, for example, social security and unemployment, education, and property rights [11] . Among Ostrom's (2005) eight principles for governing common pool resources, rules governing use of common goods should be matched with local needs and conditions [12] . Those affected by the rules should participate in modifying the rules. The authorities should respect the rule-making rights of community members and, where appropriate, graduated sanctions should be applied to rule violators. Ostrom's eight principles clearly reflect the importance of community participation in making legal rules. Additionally, stakeholders within communities should be consulted with and respected during rule making for any conservation initiatives. Thus, communities can deliver their opinions by providing their perception of legal frameworks that have a direct bearing on them and the resources on which they depend for their livelihoods. The sustainability of social and ecological systems can only be ensured with proper maintenance of the environment and its social dimensions, including social security, unemployment, education, and property rights. Shotton (1999) provides a complete discussion of property rights issues and regulation in fisheries, including why ITQs are often resisted despite their many benefits [13] . Traditionally, in the case of fishery management, legal frameworks are enacted to control harmful activities in the environment. These include gear regulations, such as the prevention of the use of nets with small mesh and certain types of trawls; restrictions applied to large, powerful types of fishing vessel; and closed fishing seasons which are commonly used [13] . The legal framework that includes laws, rules, regulations, ordinances and other instruments provides legitimacy to certain fisheries and coastal management measures [14] . These provide a buttress to the sustainable implementation of integrated coastal management programs towards achieving success. It is found that legal compliance is key to the success of coastal zone management interventions, particularly the establishment of marine protected areas [14,15] . Where non-compliance happens, understanding the key problems can provide a basis for establishing a legal framework to improve the management of coastal and marine resources [16] .  3 Methodology The study was informed by both primary and secondary data. The primary data were obtained through qualitative data collection methods, which included individual interviews, key informant interviews, and stakeholder analyses for the period from May 2016 to July 2016. The study was conducted among the fishing communities in two coastal and marine fishery hotspots of Bangladesh: the Chittagong and Barisal districts ( Fig. 1 ). Using a semi-structured questionnaire, a total of 130 individual interviews were conducted with fishers, skippers on the fishing team and fish trade entrepreneurs (locally known as mohajan/aratdhar ). The interviewees were selected through convenient sampling. The semi-structured questionnaire included questions including legal issues, management concerns, marine fisheries’ resource extraction, marketing, and implementation of fishery legislation. Fifteen government officials from different tiers of the Department of Fisheries (DoF) were interviewed as key informants. Four knowledgeable skipper fishers (majhi ) and five fish traders were also interviewed as key informants. The interviewees included a range of stakeholders, thus providing different perspectives on the main issues of the present research. Secondary data on government legislation and policy documents, ministerial orders, and gazettes were collected through an online search or personal contact with relevant agencies. A content analysis was employed for the data analysis [18–20] . A content analysis is a scientific research tool that interprets and codes different communicated material (e.g., documents, articles, books, voices, interviews, and images) through classification, tabulation, and evaluation of its key themes to ascertain its meaning and probable effect.1  1 Webster's Dictionary of the English Language.   It provides new insights, thus enhancing a researcher's understanding of particular phenomena as well as informing practical measures [18] . In the present study, textual materials were coded into manageable categories of different variables [6,21] . The variables identified included causes of non-compliance with laws, gaps between the laws and their implementation and suggestions for improvement.  4 Results 4.1 National legal framework In Bangladesh, a number of legislation measures are in operation for the preservation and sustainable use of marine resources. These measures permit the translation of the objectives of policy into specific legal provisions affecting the use of living marine fisheries resources, the way these resources affect the development of fishing communities and the nation as a whole. These acts include the Protection and Conservation of Fish Act (PCFA) of 19502  2 The Protection and Conservation of Fish Act, 1950 (Bengal act xviii of 1950). Retrieved from http://www.fisheries.gov.bd/site/view/law/Fish-Acts,-Laws-and--rules .  ; Rules of 1985; the Territorial Waters and Maritime Zones Act of 19743  3 The Territorial Waters and Maritime Zones Act, 1974 (act no. xxvi of 1974). Retrieved from, http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/print_sections_all.php?id=467 .  ; Rules of 1977; and the Marine Fisheries Ordinance and Rules, 1983.4  4 The Marine Fisheries Ordinance 1983 (ordinance no. xxxv of 1983). Retrieved from http://www.fisheries.gov.bd/site/view/law/Fish-Acts,-Laws-and--rules .   These are analysed in the following sections in terms of prohibitions, prescriptions, penalties, and responsibilities ( Table 1 ). There are different prohibitions in coastal- and marine-related legislation that were not implemented properly due to the reasons noted in  Table 2 . According to the perception of fishers and other stakeholders, there are several causes for the noncompliance of laws, conflicts, and overall mismanagement.  4.2 Violations related to mesh size, gear type, and fishing limits According to the Protection and Conservation of Fish Act of 1950, any fishing net with a mesh size less than 4.5 cm is prohibited. However, in practice, this rule is widely violated because fishers extensively use the prohibited mesh nets. The respondent fishers argued that if they adhere to the mesh size stipulated in the regulation, the fish catch will be significantly lower due to reduced fishery productivity in estuarine and coastal waters. To compensate for the low fish catch rate, the local fishermen use a modified Set Bag Net with mesh sizes less than 1 in. that are locally known as Behundi Jal  (Estuarine Set Bag Net-ESBN). In an artisanal hilsa fishery, using gillnets with a mesh size less than 10 cm is prohibited, but this is not observed in most cases as reported by some key informants. Some fishermen in the coastal areas use fixed nets such as ESBN for the collection of fry and fingerlings. This is seriously harmful to marine fish biodiversity because this gear catches fry and fingerlings irrespective of their size and type. According to the Protection and Conservation of Fish Act (PCFA) of 1950, the manufacturing, import, marketing, storing, transportation, and owning and use of monofilament gill nets (Current Jal ) are prohibited (Section 4 . A). One fisher commented that the government authority seizes illegal nets but can do very little against the producers of such nets. One manufacturer of monofilament gill nets has filed a case against the 2002 amendments of the Fish Protection and Conservation Act, 1950, through which the production, storage, and marketing of those nets were banned. Unfortunately, production continues due to the Stay Order of the High Court on ceasing their production. One key informant commented that banning all monofilament gill nets irrespective of mesh size could decrease illegal fishing by 80 percent. Several issues related to the illegal violation of limits and the resulting conflict were reported by the respondents. The Marine Fisheries Ordinance of 1983 stipulated two fishing zones for artisanal and industrial fishing, within and beyond a 40-m depth, respectively. However, the respondent fishers reported that industrial fishers often violated these boundaries and fished in areas lawfully designated for small-scale fishing. According to the Territorial Waters and Maritime Zones Act, 1974, no foreign ship or person without a license is allowed to enter the maritime zone of Bangladesh. However, this act is often violated by many foreign fishing vessels and fishermen. It is said that various types of fishing vessels from India, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Myanmar regularly violate the fishing limits of Bangladesh. Not only do they conduct illegal fishing; they also attack local fishers.  4.3 Legal enforcement and management Many fishers who operate in the hilsa sanctuaries reported that during the ban period for hilsa fishing, fishers violated the closure period and continue fishing for gravid and juvenile hilsa. The fishermen reported a number of factors behind such non-compliance. These include laxity in enforcement of the ban period in sanctuary areas; strong linkages between violators and the local political establishment; and the practice of bribery between law enforcers and local fishermen. Powerful local fish traders force fishermen to continue working. Poor and indebted fishers have to continue fishing during ban period since no other alternative occupation is available. Furthermore, incentives provided by the government are insufficient to maintain their livelihoods. The penalties incorporated into legislation are insufficient, and the financial penalties are outdated, according to one key informant. The power and functions of the fishery officers and staff in the implementation of legislation and regulations are usually not clearly specified by the respective laws and regulations. The Upazila Fisheries Officers (UFOs) alone — rather than the District Fisheries Officers (DFOs) — implement the legislation and regulations. As a result, the proper implementation of fishery laws and policies are not fully ensured. Implementation should be extended to the DFOs. It was also noted that the DFOs and UFOs face numerous problems due to not being able to impose appropriate penalties relating to the breach of rules. The punishments stipulated in the existing laws are not always properly applied by law enforcement agencies if bribes are taken from the fishers to not file charges against them or to reduce the penalties. One UFO claimed that sometimes sudden patrol campaigns were occasionally unsuccessful due to leaking of relevant information. Many of the fishers argued that if this type of corruption can be prevented, then illegal fishing would be stopped. Moreover, officials rarely inspected their boats and penalized fishers for a breach of regulations. Weak enforcement has led to the perception among most fishers that if they violate the law, the chances of being caught and punished are slim.  4.4 What needs to be done? Stakeholders’ perceptions regarding improvement of management In response to questions regarding how to overcome non-compliance and overall management constraints, a number of suggestions were elicited from the respondents. The suggestions included ‘reformation of fishery laws and regulations’; ‘control of fishing vessels and destructive fishing gears’; ‘public participation in fishery management’; ‘strengthening monitoring control and surveillance systems’; ‘strengthening cooperation among relevant agencies and stakeholders; and ‘creating opportunities for alternative occupations'. 4.4.1 Regulation of fishing gears Rule 14 of the Marine Fisheries Ordinance 1983 describes the allowable mesh sizes for five types of nets to be used by fishing vessels — shrimp trawl nets (boom), fish trawl nets, large mesh driftnets, small mesh drift nets and Set Bag Nets — and specifies the areas where such nets can be used for fishing operations. However, fishers reported that there are several nets, mostly destructive in nature, that do not fall within the purview of this rule. For example, ESBN is a gear used within the 10-m depth line that encompasses almost all brackish water bodies, channels, and tributaries. The ESBN has been found to be destructive because it also captures juvenile shrimp and fish that feed in shallow waters. Though the Marine Fisheries Ordinance 1983 specifies the mesh size for the Set Bag Net, it fails to consider the ESBN. Regulatory laws should clearly delineate what types of gear are to be regulated by which legislation. Use of monofilament gill nets is a major concern shared by the most respondents. According to the Protection and Conservation of Fish Act, 1950, section 3.3.a (iv), the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) prohibits the manufacture, fabrication, import, marketing, storing, transportation, possession and use of monofilament gill nets. However, such nets are widely used, and fishery officers only seize the nets while fishing is in progress. They are unable to prosecute the manufacturers of these nets.  4.4.2 Control of fishing licenses and the number of fishing vessels Fishing licenses specify the species of fish to be caught as well as the type of fishing gears, the methods of fishing, and the fishing areas (Section 13, The Marine Fisheries Ordinance 1983). Section 8 of the ordinance states that fishing licenses shall be required for all marine fishing in Bangladeshi waters. However, Sections 17 and 18 of the same law exempt local fishing vessels from obtaining a fishing license if they obtain registration or a valid certificate of inspection under any other existing law. The Merchant Shipping Ordinance of 1983 (Section 13) requires registration of all seagoing vessels as proof of their seaworthiness. If the provisions of the Marine Fisheries Ordinance 1983 and the Merchant Shipping Ordinance of 1983 are both followed, there is no need to obtain a fishing license under the Marine Fisheries Ordinance 1983 if a local fishing vessel has already obtained registration for seaworthiness. Nevertheless, registration of a vessel is not the same as obtaining a license for selective fishing. This legal exemption must be removed if the legislative intent is the sustainability of fishery resources. The Department of Fisheries (DoF), not the Department of Shipping, is the department that should issue this license because the DoF has information on fish stocks, the methods to be used in specified locations, the annual harvestable stock, and the capability to determine the number of vessels allowed to fish. Registration based on vessel fitness alone may result in a situation where the number of vessels exceed the carrying capacity of coastal ecosystems.  4.4.3 Strengthening Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) systems The limited logistical capacity of governmental agencies (DoF and law enforcement agencies) was often mentioned by the respondents as a restriction in monitoring, control and surveillance in the coastal zone, particularly in hilsa sanctuaries. The capacity for the high seas MCS system is also insufficient. The eleven large landing sites, their wide geographic spread (especially for the non-mechanized boats) and poor communication in many coastal districts, combined with the limited human resources allocated for catch monitoring, suggest that considerable improvements need to be made before these figures can be considered a robust management tool, as a key informant suggested. Using technology is another option to improve the MCS system in Bangladeshi fisheries. A Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) has recently been introduced to Bangladeshi fishing vessels (e.g., trawlers) by the DoF through a pilot project to improve the MCS systems by using available technologies. The coastguard plays a minimum role in preventing illegal fishing in the open sea because their surveillance is confined to nearby coastal areas. Governing authorities should take the necessary steps to enforce the fishing limits and should increase the manpower for maintaining the protection of fishing limits. The use of an automatic identification system (AIS) and radar and satellite remote sensing would be beneficial in this regard.  4.4.4 Institutional cooperation Aside from fishery-related regulations, a number of other regulations are directly or indirectly related to fisheries. These include the Wild Conservation Act 2002 administered by the Forest Department, which empowers the government to declare an MPA in the Swatch of No Ground in the Bay of Bengal. However, for proper implementation of these laws, effective collaboration is needed to overcome weak enforcement caused by institutional gaps. Strong coordination between the Forest Department and the DoF is needed for management of the water resources of the forests, which is the responsibility of the Forest Department under the Forest Act, 1927. Close coordination is also necessary with the Bangladesh Navy, the Coast Guard, and the port authorities of Chittagong and Mongla, which are responsible for controlling coastal pollution by ships. According to the provision of the Ecologically Critical Area (ECA) Regulations 1995, the Department of the Environment should develop close coordination with the DoF to tackle water pollution problems and circulate water quality standards for fishing grounds and to ensure maintenance of water quality.  4.4.5 Provision of incentives and other support for fishers during closed seasons The Bangladeshi government provides fishery subsidies in the form an incentive program for fishers in hilsa sanctuaries who are affected by closed seasons or fishery closures. However, this program does not cover all affected fishers, and some influential fishery stakeholders, such as fish traders, are excluded. The fisher respondents suggested that an incentive program needs to include all affected fishers in the hilsa sanctuaries. Along with rice incentives, cash supports should be provided. Limited livelihood opportunities are considered one of the main reasons for violating the regulations. Fishing is the only occupation for most people in fishing communities in our study areas. The fishers have responded that their dependence on fishing motivates them to catch as much as they can without any concern for conservation and management regulations. Many of the fishers argued that it is unfair to impose regulations regarding a ban on fishing in natural waters without creating opportunities for alternative livelihoods. Therefore, the generation of an alternative income source and proper training could be effective in resolving this situation. Several respondents also discussed creating alternative income opportunities for themselves and other family members during closed seasons. A few key informants said that poverty and lack of alternative income earning opportunities often push unemployed people into fisheries, thus leading to over-capitalization in coastal fisheries, particularly in hilsa fishing.  4.4.6 Information disclosure and public participation Given that most fishers in Bangladesh are not literate, they do not have proper and thorough knowledge of the existing fishing laws and their prohibitions. Many fishers also do not have enough practical knowledge regarding mesh size regulations. Some fishers said that they had never heard of this type of regulation before the interview. Therefore, a few respondents suggested that to ensure more frequent participation in the various programs, the government should take steps to make fishermen aware of fishery laws and their significance. To raise general public awareness of issues relating to fisheries resources, NGOs must contribute in an effective way. Knowledge of environmental laws and regulations must be delivered to the public as well, and they must be aware that protection of fishery resources from being contaminated is their legal and social duty. Considering the general educational status of the fishers, it is suggested that providing summarized and basic aspects of fishing laws to the entire fishing community could be included in the responsibilities of UFOs and Assistant Upazila Fisheries Officers for mass awareness generation among the fishers.    5 Discussion It is a general principle of jurisprudence that laws should be updated; otherwise, they may fail to fulfil their core objectives. Most of the legislation and regulations for governing coastal and marine living resources in Bangladesh were enacted a long time ago and have been amended to keep pace with changing circumstances. In the context of rapid changes in social, economic, cultural and environmental circumstances, the legal framework now appears insufficient for tackling new challenges [8] . Thus, an update is necessary, not least to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). There are several targets in SDG 14 in particular, which call for actions explicitly related to coastal and marine living resources, such as effectively regulating the harvesting of fishery resources; ending overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and destructive fishing practices; addressing fishery subsidies; increasing economic benefits from the sustainable management of fisheries and aquaculture; and providing access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets. Other related targets cover marine pollution prevention, the management of marine and coastal ecosystems, and the implementation of both the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the applicable existing, high-priority regional and international regimes for fisheries and aquaculture (p. 170) (FAO 2016).5  5 FAO. 2016. The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2016. Contributing to food security and nutrition for all. Rome. 200 pp.   In achieving all targets related to SDG 14, the importance of strengthening the implementation of legal and policy instruments was underlined in the ‘calls for action’ document of the United Nations Ocean Conference 2017. The document reiterated that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provided the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out, while effective implementation of national legislation is also equally important. National legislation and regulatory frameworks are a critical part of the international legal regime as they implement the obligations of international law [23] . The Bangladeshi government has taken various legislative measures to protect, conserve and enhance the ecological sustainability of fish and other marine species. These measures include a 65-day fishing ban for all types of fish, an 8-month fishing ban for juvenile hilsa fish of less than 25 cm, a 22-day ban on catching brood hilsa every year in the coastal waters and EEZ of Bangladesh in the Bay of Bengal, and a total ban on destructive fishing practices in marine areas. All these measures aim to prevent illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and strengthen the management of marine and coastal ecosystems. These measures bring positive impacts, such as increased hilsa production in the sanctuaries [8,24] . However, as the present study indicates, fishing during the closed season period in the hilsa sanctuaries, and fishing by foreign fishing vessels in Bangladesh waters lead to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Coastal fisheries also face additional challenges, such as destructive fishing practices (e.g., the use of monofilament gill nets), some of which are clearly linked to legal issues. In the present legal framework, there is a lack of rules for the regulation of coastal fisheries, although most intense fishing occurs in the coastal zone [25] . As the fishers suggested, improved management of living coastal and marine resources management, such as ending IUU fishing and the use of destructive fishing gears, requires effective implementation of the legal framework. To compensate for the loss of income during fishery closures, the Bangladeshi government provides fishery subsidies in the form of rice distribution of 40 kg to registered fishers. However, increases in fishery subsidies are discouraged by SDG 14, which calls for the end of harmful fishery subsidies since these may contribute to overfishing and overcapacity. However, Mohammed et al. (2017) considered the hilsa fishery subsidy a positive fiscal policy that delivers positive economic, social and environmental outcomes [26] . The existing fishery subsidy plays a positive role in hilsa conservation and thus should be continued and made more comprehensive to include other fishery stakeholders who are also affected by fishery closures, such as fish traders. To make fishery regulation more compliant, it is important to understand the causes of non-compliance and potential ways of addressing these causes. A comprehensive legal framework alone is not sufficient for living marine resource management, and other steps are required. Poverty is widely reported as the major reason why poor fishers violate regulations for fishery closures and destructive fishing [8,27] . Creating economic opportunities outside the fishery sector could encourage some fishers to leave the fisheries if they are satisfied with an alternative occupation. Global experience suggests that livelihood interventions need to be designed in consultation with the communities rather than only by the implementing agencies. A livelihood intervention needs to build on the existing livelihood strategies, needs, and assets of the target households. Livelihood projects for fishing communities need to take a holistic approach to livelihood intervention by not focusing on production alone but also including all parts of the value chain. It is not just about giving fishers an alternative occupation; it requires addressing fundamental social, economic and environmental reforms that affect fishing communities and their livelihoods [28] . According to the Marine Fisheries Ordinance 1983, small-scale coastal fishers can fish in coastal waters within a 40 m depth at the highest tide. The rule excluded industrial trawlers from this zone. Even though traditional small-scale coastal fishers enjoy open access to fisheries resources, their access is often restricted in practice. For example, industrial fishing trawlers who are supposed to fish in waters beyond a 40-m depth often fish much closer to shore where they are not allowed (at 30-m and even 20-m depths) [29] . The target of SDG 14 ensures the access of artisanal fishers to coastal and marine resources. Artisanal fisheries are well suited to community property rights systems. The introduction of community rights helps to restructure the resource into a regulated common property, increases economic efficiency through higher product values or fewer costs (including lower levels of investment in fishing vessels) or both.6  6 Hannesson, R. (2004). The Privatization of the Oceans. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.   Providing ownership of a fish stock would certainly act as an incentive for fishers as nature permits to reap the full benefits of saving fish to improve catches in the future. The enforcement of tenure rights will pave the way for shifting to area-based licensing, particularly for hilsa fisheries. Such arrangements would compel fishermen to 'police' rogue and illegal fishing activities in their areas, which will substantially reduce the cost for the government for MCS activities. As hilsa fisheries extend across national boundaries over a large area, community ownership through tenure rights would entail far-ranging cooperation with neighbouring countries. At present, as an open access fishery, there is no state-allocated legal ownership of fishing areas in the coastal and marine waters of Bangladesh. However, there some examples of maintaining community ownership over coastal fishing space. Artisanal fishers on the Chittagong coast maintain socially organized, locally enforceable, and hereditary entitlements regarding access and use of fishing space. This system, known locally as Pata [29] , could act as a working example of possible implementation of community rights over fishing space in hilsa sanctuaries, mangrove forests, and other coastal ecosystems. Similarly, there is a need for better regulation of high seas fisheries. Bangladesh is now in the early stages of formulating an appropriate strategy to harness the potential of the Blue Economy,7  7 http://www.oceanactionhub.org/file/1668/download?token=76XeYodT .   where high seas fisheries are an important focus of attention. Before engaging in industrial and distant water fishing, it is important to consider legal issues to ensure sustainable fishing. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides the legal framework for the conservation, and the sustainable use of oceans and their resources could support the development of a national policy for high seas fishing in Bangladesh. Overall, a number of other management strategies are needed to achieve the targets of SDG 14, which also require support from a national legal framework. Effective monitoring and surveillance requires sufficient logistical support for fishery officials and law enforcement agencies. The role of technology in improving monitoring, control and surveillance to combat IUU fishing has been highlighted. Enhancing national capacity for ocean governance, enhancing control and surveillance activities and planning as part of regional governance to achieve the SDG14 should be prioritized. National plans for sustainable management of marine and coastal ecosystems are instrumental. Some legal and implementation gaps exist in the implementation of the international legal framework. Areas requiring further capacity-building and funding included technical, human and financial resources for hydrographic and legal expertise, the development of legislation and monitoring, control and surveillance and enforcement. Building awareness regarding fishery regulations as well as the importance of living coastal and marine resources is important strategies that will be beneficial [23] .  6 Conclusion In Bangladesh, despite significant interest in economic, political, and development programs, environmental sustainability policies are often ignored. Ensuring sustainable development by developing the blue economy will not be possible without enacting an integrated maritime policy. Thus, creating the appropriate legislative framework is fundamental to the effective implementation of the marine resource policy. In recent decades, the Bangladeshi government has emphasized environmental conservation. The government's commitment towards sustainable environmental management is reflected in the 15th amendment of the Constitution, in which Article 18A calls for the protection and improvement of the environment and biodiversity in Bangladesh. Until recently, the conservation and management of coastal and marine living resources have received lower priority compared to inland fisheries and other land-based ecosystems. With the advent of the blue economy concept and SDG targets, the government has emphasized the exploitation of coastal and marine resources. However, economic prosperity based on ocean resources should not occur at the expense of environmental sustainability. Achieving the targets related to SDG 14 will ensure sustainability of the coastal and marine environment for which an appropriate legal framework is a necessary tool. The existing legal framework covers the issues of fisheries conservation, ecosystem management, and biodiversity protection. However, implementation of these provisions is often hindered by limitations noncompliance, which is driven by poverty, poor governance, and conflicts among different stakeholders. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 14, the legal framework governing the Bangladeshi fishery sector needs to be improved through measures such as governance reform, increasing coordination between administrative bodies and education of key stakeholders, including fishermen. In developing a comprehensive legal framework, cultural, social and economic barriers of the targeted communities need to be considered, and the communities should be consulted. The perceptions of the local community should be taken into consideration. Finally, ensuring good governance at each step is recommended as a fundamental prerequisite for sustainable utilization and management of coastal and marine living resources.
