It also adversely affects quality of life, both in the developed and developing world,3   and has a huge impact on productivity.4   In 2015, the UN announced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) , most of which are related to improving health and productivity. However, there is conflicting evidence from different studies showing that investment in health improves productivity.5–8   It is also known that the global labour productivity has slowed down negatively, affecting the global economy. Hence, the randomised trial by Priya Adhisesha Reddy and colleagues in The Lancet Global Health  is a useful addition to what is already known about the impact of health interventions on productivity.9   The study shows that a simple pair of presbyopic glasses in tea workers (mainly women) in India improved their productivity by more than 20%. Moreover, with increasing age, productivity increased in the intervention group, but it decreased in the control group, indicating the adverse effects of uncorrected presbyopia on productivity with increasing age. Productivity in the intervention group also increased with increased compliance to glasses and consequent improvement in quality of life. Nearly 95% of trial participants were willing to pay for the glasses if lost or broken. The authors acknowledge the limited generalisability of their findings. Hence, they suggest additional trials in different cohorts in different countries. Although they provided the mean productivity before and after the intervention, no information is available about the median values and the range. The authors are urged to provide this information as it is possible that some participants in the intervention group did not show a significant change in productivity and vice versa. It would be good to understand these additional factors that can influence productivity. Also since the baseline period was in June, 2017, and assessment was done in the peak period (July–October, 2017), there could have been an increased difference in productivity in both groups due to seasonal variation. It would be interesting to see whether this high difference in productivity persists at all ages and in other seasons of the year. As participants were from three estates, it is likely that they were from nearby villages and so a clustering effect cannot be ruled out. The study does not describe the effects of clustering on the results. Finally, as acknowledged by the authors, a placebo effect could not be studied because the control group was not given glasses. Prospectively, additional trials in different cohorts in different countries are needed to understand the impact of presbyopic correction on productivity. Functional presbyopia (ie, vision less than N8 restored to N8 with correction) has to be differentiated from objective presbyopia, which includes individuals who need correction both for distance and near vision, to plan for targeted interventions. Research is needed to understand the cost-effectiveness of glasses compared with other interventions such as cataract surgery; and operational research is also needed to develop strategies for broad-scale implementation to improve productivity and contribute to the SDGs. We declare no competing interests.
