                  Water–Sanitation–Hygiene (WASH) remains vital for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, yet many countries have not localised the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 6, which focuses on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Even in leading African economies such as South Africa, many communities still use the bucket system for sanitation. Using a Composite Index drawn from three indicators whose data were available for 53 of the 54 African countries, it emerged that these states are at various stages of fulfilling the targets set out in SDG 6. The fact that some countries showed declining trends in WASH between 2000 and 2015, is an indication that it will be difficult for Africa to reach the 2030 targets. We recommend that Africa aggressively mobilise resources if it is to attain universal WASH services by 2030, along with other SDG 6-related targets.

Editor: Ouyang Wei Water–Sanitation–Hygiene (WASH) remains vital for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, yet many countries have not localised the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 6, which focuses on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Even in leading African economies such as South Africa, many communities still use the bucket system for sanitation. Using a Composite Index drawn from three indicators whose data were available for 53 of the 54 African countries, it emerged that these states are at various stages of fulfilling the targets set out in SDG 6. The fact that some countries showed declining trends in WASH between 2000 and 2015, is an indication that it will be difficult for Africa to reach the 2030 targets. We recommend that Africa aggressively mobilise resources if it is to attain universal WASH services by 2030, along with other SDG 6-related targets.

Globally, many river basins will likely experience low water volumes in the coming decades, due to global warming and the ensuing climate change (Gain et al., 2016 ). Climate change brings extreme weather events, such as drought, flooding and heatwaves – all of which have some impact on the availability of water in both rural and urban settings. Linked to water are issues related to sustainable sanitation. In fact, Giné-Garriga et al. (2013)  identify the water–sanitation–hygiene (WASH) link as fundamental to addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 6, which focuses on ensuring “the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” by 2030 (United Nations, 2015a : 14). To address the WASH link, Giné-Garriga et al. (2013)  identify a need to improve the collection (at the local level) of both accurate and accessible data. In turn, decision makers and water resource managers exploit such data for planning purposes, and for monitoring, evaluating and verifying progress towards the achievement of set targets (here, the 2030 targets). For the sake of completeness, the details of SDG 6 are presented in Box 1  . In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), for the period 2000–2015, Bain et al. (2018)  observed an annual rate of change of 57.6% of the total population with access to basic drinking water services (90.6% for North Africa and Western Asia), and 28.1% for basic sanitation in SSA (86.1% in North Africa and Western Asia). As regards basic hygiene, there was a 15.4% change in SSA (76.3% for North Africa and Western Asia), while as regards open defecation, the figures were significantly higher for SSA (22.9%) (North Africa and Western Asia recorded 4.1%). In Indonesia, for instance, WASH in schools remains low (Karon et al., 2017 ) and this impacts negatively on child health, development and education. Karon et al.'s findings prompted the United Nations Children Fund to intervene in 450 schools across three provinces. It was found that schools with a toilet operation and maintenance fund were more likely to have functional toilets. It also emerged that students who learnt hygiene from their teachers were more likely pass that knowledge on to their parents, to wash their hands and to avoid open defecation. In the 2019 State of the Nation Address (Sona) (the Presidency, 2019 ), it emerged that two learners had recently drowned in pit toilets – one at Mahlodumela Primary School in Limpopo Province in 2014, and the other at Luna Junior Primary School in the Eastern Cape in 2018. A total of 4000 schools were identified, through a national audit, as still having inappropriate sanitation facilities in 2018. Following the audit, the government launched the Sanitation Appropriate for Education (SAFE) initiative in August 2018. By February 2019, a total of 699 schools had been provided with safe and appropriate sanitation facilities, while an additional 1500 schools had projects at various levels of implementation. The government is committed to eradicating pit toilets and other undignified sanitation facilities in schools, through SAFE, by 2022. Given these challenges, international consultations leading to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (AfSD) (United Nations, 2015a ) have called for the prioritisation of indicators to monitor progress on non-household WASH facilities. Leigland et al. (2016) , who conducted research on behalf of the World Bank, have brought an added dimension to WASH. These authors contend that achieving universal access to water and sanitation by 2030 requires blended financing. There is an acknowledgement that the millennium development goals (MDGs) have helped rally nations around the world to work towards a common goal, namely to improve WASH, since at the close of the MDGs, millions of people had access to improved water supply and sanitation. However, millions more still lack access to such facilities, which is why SDG 6 sets ambitious targets – especially points 6.1 and 6.2, which speak to universal access. To achieve this end, significant financial mobilisation will be needed, since WASH infrastructure remains capital intensive. In fact, Martínez-Santos (2017)  questions the so-called success of the MDGs as, in his view, the set targets – which solely measured access to improved water sources – disregarded the fact that many such sources remain polluted, unreliable and/or unaffordable. If this line of thinking were maintained in the SDGs, it would have created confusion in terms of investment in the water and sanitation sector. Given the foregoing, this article attempts to answer the question: Is the year 2030 too soon for Africa to achieve the water and sanitation SDG? Thomson and Koehler (2016)  are clear that the SDG 6 targets remain ambitious, and that achieving them will demand both a special focus and sustained resourcing. The next section provides details on the relevant literature framing the current research.  2 Literature survey The African continent remains endowed with large water resources that include lakes, rivers, swamps and aquifers (Mugagga and Nabaasa, 2016 ). Africa's water resources, many of which have been neglected and polluted, are central to the realisation of all the SDGs, and the water and sanitation SDG specifically. The sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, as outlined in SDG 6, has both direct and indirect benefits (Singh et al., 2018 ), given that water and sanitation issues are present across the SDGs. In this respect, Mugagga and Nabaasa (2016)  link SDG 6 to other SDGs dealing with poverty eradication, food security, health, oceans and biodiversity. To this list one may add the education, gender, energy, jobs, industrialisation and infrastructure development, and cities and human settlements SDGs. In fact, additional relationships can still be observed with other SDGs not mentioned here. Fisher et al. (2017)  remain resolute that WASH has always mirrored gender issues, as related debates are shaped by the needs of women. So important is WASH in Africa, that the organisation Oxfam focused on gender mainstreaming to address challenges around the Ebola outbreak in West Africa (Carter et al., 2017 ). In fact, a number of SDGs make specific references to water: SDG 3 (health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 11 (sustainable cities), SDG 12 (sustainable consumption and production) and SDG 15 (life on land) (United Nations, 2018a ). Overall, SDG 6 remains a key multiplier effect goal, hence this article's opening statement that ‘water is life’. Mugagga and Nabaasa (2016)  call upon African governments to increase their commitment to sustaining and conserving water resources, as this will influence and possibly decide the continent's future development pathways. Ait-Kadi (2016: 106)  introduced the concept of “Water for Development and Development for Water”, which magnifies Shah's (2016)  thinking on how water is embedded in almost all 17 SDGs, thus becoming their heartbeat. Shah further introduces a need to focus on IWRM as a critical pillar to attaining SDG 6. This thinking augments Zhang et al.'s (2016)  view, advocating for a systems approach to SDG implementation. From these authors' conceptualisation of the issues it is clear the focus must extend beyond SDG 6, to embrace the sum total of all 17 SDGs in their entirety. Sambu (2016)  is concerned about the impact global WASH initiatives have on Africa, noting that the poor blending of new and old global WASH agendas has created discord between one initiative and the next. Examples include the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade initiative (1981–1990) and the International Water for Life Decade (2005–2015). The former initiative failed to meet the target of ‘water for all’, and the latter fell short of reducing (by 50%) the number of people without access to water, as had been projected at the start of the scheme. Question may thus be asked about whether the revised targets under SDG 6 and the third global WASH initiative will be attained by 2030 (United Nations, 2018b ). Sambu (2016)  further cautions that one of the main reasons for these failures, is that the revised global WASH initiatives failed to recognise dynamics on the ground at the national, regional and continental spatial levels. Such initiatives sought to cover programmes and policies, some of which would be long-term in nature, and that would have exhausted energies in negotiations with key stakeholders. New initiatives may also end up dampening the excitement among key stakeholders. In Africa, where government agendas remain embedded in ruling parties and their political agendas, as well as political and social instability (Salih, 2005 ), new WASH initiatives can easily be lost in transition. Hanging over all these challenges, there is a blanket of corruption and nepotism that brings an additional layer of complexity to WASH programming. Tussupova et al. (2016)  observe that, in Kazakhstan, the MDGs left the rural areas lagging behind the urban areas, and hope the SDGs' implementation will aim to close that gap. The main challenge, however, is that there is limited or no data available at the village level. From the study, Tussupova found that 65% of ruralites in that country were willing to be connected and to pay for a piped water supply. Drawing on the current SDG 6 indicators, Thomson and Koehler (2016)  propose that future work should go beyond the usual monitoring and evaluation (M&E) paradigm, and extend to surveillance systems that may result in improved operational performance and financial stability in WASH services, especially at the local level. Fuller et al. (2016) , who tracked progress towards SDG 6 targets both within and among countries, acknowledge significant WASH improvements under the banner of the MDGs, but their findings reveal that substantial heterogeneity remains between states in terms of progress, as well as inequality within states. This kind of pattern is likely to emerge across the African continent. Giné-Garriga et al. (2017)  propose that M&E in WASH in the 2030 AfSD be viewed through the lens of human rights, while Hoekstra et al. (2017)  raise concerns about the lack of equity targets under SDG 6. Chakravarty et al. (2017)  add to the debate around equity, by referring to WASH and the dignity of all people. During a study in Pune (Maharashtra) and Jaipur (Rajasthan) (both in India), Kulkarni et al. (2017)  observed that women in informal settlements faced harassment and violence related to poor and/or absent sanitation facilities. In fact, compared to water access, adequate sanitation remains a huge concern in South-East Asia, as continued open defecation remains a problem. With the number of diarrhoea cases declining significantly between 1990 and 2012, inadequate WASH results in 1000 child deaths daily, worldwide (Kulkarni et al., 2017 ). A study by Leder et al. (2017)  focuses on how women are disadvantaged in WASH (particularly as regards water security matters) through the use of discriminatory apolitically and technically framed narratives in Western Nepal. The authors call for an understanding of both inter and intra-household relations in communities, leading to a context-specific conceptualisation of women's empowerment. Such empowerment should go beyond access and opportunities, to develop platforms that cover social networks and value creation. The issues highlighted here, leads the author of this article to call upon policymakers and those involved in WASH to bring in big data that separates WASH activities by gender. Vedachalam et al. (2017)  raise concerns about the underreporting of high-risk WASH practices which could undermine progress on the achievement of SDG 6: fourteen rounds of mobile phone household surveys in Asia and Africa, which sampled 245,054 respondents, showed that there was underreporting of 25 million people consuming unimproved water regularly, and 50 million people regularly practising open defecation. In similar work, Bain et al. (2018)  deliberated on SDG 6 baselines for WASH. The authors reflected on the process of establishing household WASH indicators, and their subsequent methodology utilised 3000 national data sources, a household survey of 1443 respondents, 309 censuses and 1494 administrative datasets. From the data of 96 and 84 countries respectively, the findings estimated that 2.1 billion people (29%) lacked safely managed drinking water services, while 4.5 billion (61%) did not have at least access to safe sanitation services in 2015. In addition, most countries had data for access to at least safe drinking water and sanitation services, but few had statistics pertaining to handwashing facilities. Data gaps remain a major challenge in many developing nations, as will be revealed in the methodology section. This situation also obtains in Africa. Chatterley et al. (2018)  audited data availability for non-household WASH in ten countries that included seven from Latin America and the Caribbean (Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras and Peru), two from Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia) and one from Oceania (Papua New Guinea). Their research revealed significant instances of missing data, especially as regards healthcare facilities. As such, none of the aforementioned countries could provide all the data needed to draw up comprehensive SDG 6 progress monitoring baselines. Generally speaking, issues pertaining to data remain a concern under the SDGs (Nhamo et al., 2018 ) and in this case SDG 6, in particular. The next section elaborates on the methodological orientation applied in this article.  3 Methodology The article focuses on drawing up SDG 6 country baselines for the African continent – an undertaking informed by the United Nations Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) (2018) . Three objectives were set, namely to (1) establish general trends in basic drinking water and sanitation services for a period of 16 years (2000–2015); (2) determine the status quo, as at 2015, based on a Composite Index (CI) that uses selected indicators subject to data availability; and (3) establish whether the sampled countries will be able to attain components of the SDG 6 targets (from which the indicators were drawn) by 2030. From the 12 indicators drawn from SDG 6 targets, only three with data available for 53 of the 54 African countries were used – a sample which almost represents a census of African states. Of the 54 African nations, only the Seychelles was excluded, based on the indicators used. Had the index ‘hand-washing facility with soap and water’ been included in the CI computation, this would have discounted 13 countries (Botswana, Cape Verde, Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, the Gabon, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Niger, the Seychelles, South Africa and South Sudan) which have no such data. In the interests of a larger and all-inclusive sample, this indicator was thus dropped. Adding more indicators would gradually have discounted many more countries, thereby steadily diminishing the sample. Given this scenario, future work can include more indicators, as these become available. The three indicators included both Tier I and II from the IAEG-SDGs (2018)  classification. A Tier 1 indicator is one that is “conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards available, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50% of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant” (IAEG-SDGs, 2018 : 2). This differs slightly from a Tier II indicator, whose single major deviation is that data are not regularly collected by countries. The data were drawn from the World Development Indicators (WDI) 2015 datasets (2014 for water stress) and the CI, which has been applied extensively by Sachs et al. (2016) , who developed a global report on the SDG index and some dashboards, while Schmidt-Traub et al. (2017)  focused on national baselines for the SDGs. Kararach et al. (2018)  worked on an African pilot green growth index, while Nhamo et al. (2018)  developed an Afro-barometer for tracking progress in achieving the gender SDG. In this work, to compute a CI the authors made use of three indicators: access to at least basic drinking water services, access to at least basic sanitation services, and water stress (Table 1  ). The initial analysis focused on general trends, which included obtaining 16-year averages for basic drinking water and sanitation services indicators, and ranking the countries. Thereafter, trends were plotted for each. This analysis could not be done for water stress, as there was only one data point for 2015. The top and bottom ten countries were isolated for further analysis, including identifying those showing rapid growth or decline (from among the 53 countries) for access to at least drinking water, and sanitation services indicators. Continental trends were plotted based on annual averages for the period under review (2000–2015). The emerging findings were mirrored against selected literature, to make for richer discussions. The second layer of data analysis focused on computing the SDG 6 status quo CI. The raw data from the WDI was normalised using the min-max method. This implied rescaling the indicators from a score of 0–100; with 0 being the lowest (worst) and 100 the highest (best) possible score. Such a computation permits between- and across-country score comparisons. The min-max method had been used earlier for the SDG Index (Sachs et al., 2016 ; Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ), the computation of the Afro-barometer for SDG 5 that focuses on gender empowerment (Nhamo et al., 2018 ) and an agriculture-related SDG index (Nhemachena et al., 2018 ). Given that the SDGs indicators are considered to be of equal importance, equal weighting was granted to each of the three indicators, with a 33.33-points equal weighting score. The CI for the selected SDG 6 indicators for each country, thus, c , was estimated as a linear weighted aggregate function of N  normalised indicators y it   with weights w i  . The following equation was therefore applied for each country:SDG 6 CI c t  = ∑ i = 1  N  w i  ∙ y it t   ∑ i = 1  N  w i       where  y it t  = x it t  − min x i t    range x it t        where x it  t   represents indicator, I , for country, c , in time, t , w i   represents weight for indicator i , min(x i  t  ) is the minimum value of indicator i  across all countries in time t , range (x it  t  ) represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values of each indictor across the countries in time t . The CI for selected SDG 6 indicators was estimated using the re-scaled values of the indicators. Since no statistically significant variances in the CI were expected from using the alternative method of standardised values of the indicators, only this method was applied. The arithmetic method was used to aggregate CI for selected SDG 6 indicators for each country, c , with graphs and tables used to sum up and present the results of the CI. The following section presents the data and discusses the key findings.  4 Presentation of data and discussion of findings This section is sub-divided into two. The first presents general trends for access to at least basic drinking water and sanitation services. The second narrows this down, to address the status quo CI for SDG 6, drawn from the three indicators discussed at length in the methodology section. 4.1 Trends in access to basic drinking water and sanitation services This section presents general trends in raw data for two indicators: access to at least basic drinking water supply, and sanitation services. The trend in access to basic drinking water supply services (Fig. 1  ) reveals an upward movement. However, there was a slowdown during 2010 and 2011 – a possible indicator of reduced overseas development assistance (ODA) flows to the continent, due to the global financial meltdown. The annual averages for the 53 sampled countries combined reveal that Africa moved from 57.21% coverage on access to at least basic drinking water supply services in 2000, to 66.54% in 2015. All things being equal, that growth pattern will not translate into 100% coverage in 2030, as envisaged. Although coming from low baselines, the bottom ten countries (based on the 16-year annual average) generally reflected concerted efforts to improve their citizens' access to at least basic drinking water supply services. While Eritrea was the only outlier characterised by insignificant movement over the period under study, countries such as Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia and Tanzania registered huge leaps (Fig. 2  ). In fact, Eritrea remains anchored at the bottom of the 53 countries sampled. The top ten performers in access to at least basic drinking water services are shown in Fig. 3  . Generally, the top ten performing countries maintained consistency in having their population using a basic drinking water supply service – the only noticeable divergence was the Comores, which recorded reduced access. Cabo Verde and the Gabon registered gradual increases in their population accessing basic drinking water supply services post-2000. Note that Libya only had data from 2010, and although not featuring among the bottom or top ten countries, Zimbabwe revealed a worrying declining trend in respect of its population's access to at least basic water supply services. Coming in at 20th position overall, that country's negative trend could be a result of more people having moved to new settlements under the government's fast-track land reform programme of 2000. The challenge could also be associated with neglected maintenance of aging water supply infrastructure, as the government faced sustained sanctions from the European Union and the United States, while its budget deficit continued to grow over the years. Sanctions may have gradually squeezed external financial support for WASH, which resulted in the country battling cholera outbreaks. The 13 countries that showed good progress over the years, regardless of their overall ranking on the CI discussed later, appear in Fig. 4  . Their ranking is based on raw data for the particular single indicator ‘access to at least basic drinking water supply services’ and the annual percentage increase. Of the 13 countries, Mali was the strongest performer over the 16-year period, ranking 26th out of the 53 countries. Lessons could be learnt from these countries regarding what they did right to push towards having more of their citizens accessing at least basic drinking water supply services. In fact, Mali's figures for people with access to at least basic drinking water supply services improved from 49.22% in 2000 to 74.27% in 2015 – up by a massive 50.9%. All things being equal, Mali could be very close to attaining universal access to at least basic drinking water supply services by 2030. Given the limited space, the authors will not analyse this scenario in depth. As for rankings in terms of the percentage of the total population using at least basic sanitation services, the general trend is shown in Fig. 5  . The continent moved upwards from a low of 34.30% in 2000, to about 40.09% in 2015. This movement is encouraging although it remains low at a 16.9% rise in 16 years. All things being equal, the assumption is that the continent may not be able to reach universal access by 2030, as anticipated. In addition, the general trend shows a slowdown and even a decline from 2009 to 2011, the same period characterised by the global financial meltdown, and a possible indicator of reduced ODA flows to the continent, as observed earlier (see drinking water services). The global financial meltdown of 2008, followed the collapse of the banking sector in the United States (Nhamo, 2013 ). As this article was being concluded, the world was heading for another financial slowdown. To this end, there is a chance that ODA into WASH will be declining, which could have an impact on service delivery in respect of sanitation. The bottom ten countries, based on the 16-year averages, appear in Fig. 6  . Per country annual averages, which range between 5.06% for Ethiopia and 12.75% for Ghana, take into account annual figures from 2000 to 2015. The figures are shockingly low by any standards, and these countries will certainly not be anywhere near the 100% access to at least basic sanitation services by 2030. While all other countries in this cohort showed their good intentions through upward trends, Chad was the odd one out with a declining trend. In fact, its population with access to at least basic sanitation services stood at 9.9% in 2000, declining to 9.68% in 2015. Note that the data for South Sudan dated from 2011, because the country had recently seceded from Sudan. Trends for the top ten countries, based on 16-year averages, are presented in Fig. 7  . While the general trends either show some upward movement or maintain the relatively high levels of basic sanitation services, one country – Equatorial Guinea – showed a declining trend. In 2000, 80.18% of the population had access to at least basic sanitation services, yet the figure recorded in 2015 was lower, at 76.98%. Morocco, South Africa and Tunisia showed an upward movement for the period 2000–2015; from 68.67 to 76.44% (Morocco), 59.39 to 66.5% (South Africa) and 80.44 to 87.08% (Tunisia). While it may be difficult for South Africa to attain 100% coverage for basic sanitation (as signified by some communities still using the bucket system at this time), Tunisia is likely to reach the 2030 target. Other top ten countries with a 16-year average coverage of 85% and above include Algeria, Mauritius, Egypt, the Seychelles and Libya. However, based on the selected indicators and data availability, the Seychelles did not make it to the final CI sample of 53 countries. It is also interesting to note that four countries from North Africa made it into the top ten, with their population having access to at least basic sanitation services. A striking aspect across the 53 sampled countries is the declining trend in access to at least basic sanitation services. This tells the story that basic sanitation service provision is dynamic, hence countries may need to constantly invest in new infrastructure while maintaining existing systems. The details of the countries in decline are shown in Fig. 8  . Although all eight countries showed declining trends in basic sanitation services, the Gambia and Equatorial Guinea were the worst in this regard. The Gambia moved from 55.22% of its population having access to at least basic sanitation services in 2000, to below half (41.69%) in 2015. During the same period, Equatorial Guinea moved from 80.18 to 74.54% of its total population having access to at least basic sanitation services. The main difference, however, is that unlike the Gambia, Equatorial Guinea ranks among the top ten performing countries. The emerging findings on declining and low access to basic sanitation services, which include Ethiopia and Kenya, confirm recent findings on WASH covering 2270 randomly sampled rural schools in Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia: a study by Morgan et al. (2017) , found that fewer than 23% of the schools in these five countries met the World Health Organization's recommended student-to-latrine ratios for girls and boys.  4.2 A focus on the CI The overall reflection of the CI is shown in Fig. 9  , with the top ten countries (ranked 1st to 10th) being Mauritius, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, South Africa, Cabo Verde, Botswana, the Gabon and Djibouti. The weighted scores range from 72.48 out of a possible 100 for Djibouti, to 96.19 for Mauritius. Good practice cases may be drawn from the policies implemented by these countries. At the bottom of the ladder are ten countries (ranked 44th to 53rd) that include Mozambique, South Sudan, Congo, Madagascar, Niger, Uganda, Somalia, Chad, Ethiopia and Eritrea. The rest of the rankings, which include all 53 countries, are presented in Table 2  . Nine of the bottom ten countries had weighted scores below 50 points, while 16 scored between 50 and 59 points. Fifteen other countries scored between 60 and 69 weighted points, with six countries managing between 70 and 79 points. The remaining seven countries scored 80 plus weighted points. Assuming that a cut-off point (for countries likely to meet the targets for the three identified indicators) is set at 70 points, only 13 of the 53 African countries for which data were analysed, are likely to meet the 2030 targets of SDG 6. This proposition further assumes there will be no adverse factors leading to a decline in the already high scores reported. In Fig. 9 , the Y-axis represents both the normalised scores for the three indicators and the CI scores. For each indicator used (drinking water, sanitation and water stress), the maximum score is 33.33 points. However, for the CI, the score can reach 100 points. The plots for weighted individual indicators and the SDG 6 CI are reflected in Fig. 10  . From the weighted scores, the ten countries which are least concerned about water stress (ranked 1st to 10th) are Congo, the Central African Republic, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Equatorial Guinea, the Gabon, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe, and Cameroon. The ten countries with the greatest water stress (ranked 44th to 53rd) include Mauritius, Somalia, Swaziland, South Africa, Morocco, Algeria, Sudan, Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. The United Nations (2018a)  estimates that over two billion people live in countries experiencing high levels of water stress – a scenario which obtains across all continents. Countries recording figures of more than 70% are considered to be seriously stressed. However, countries with water stress levels above 100% include Egypt and Libya (in Africa) and Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait (in the Middle East), which are now mainly meeting their water demands through the use of desalination. An 11% global water stress level is reported, and there are significant differences among countries and regions. There are also hidden stress levels at the national level, since some areas are both wet and dry. Northern Africa and Western Asia (79% average) and Central and Southern Asia (66% average) are reported to suffer severe water stress, while the figure for SSA is extremely low at 3% (United Nations, 2018a ). As regards access to basic drinking water supply services, the top ten countries (ranked from 1st to 10th) are Mauritius, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, the Gabon, Cabo Verde, South Africa, the Comoros and Morocco. Five of these countries are in North Africa. Those occupying the bottom ten positions (44th to 53rd) are Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique, Niger, Chad, the DRC, Angola, Somalia, Ethiopia, Uganda and Eritrea. Lastly, countries with high access to at least basic sanitation services (ranked from 1st to 10th) include Libya, Egypt, Mauritius, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Equatorial Guinea, South Africa, Cabo Verde and Rwanda. Of these ten countries, five are in North Africa. The bottom ten countries (44th to 53rd) are Sierra Leone, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Niger, Eritrea, South Sudan, Madagascar, Chad and Ethiopia. This analysis serves to assists policymakers such as the African Union and its development partners, which include the African Development Bank and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, in seeing the emerging picture by working from the baselines, before developing targeted programmes for specific member states and regional economic communities. Good case practices can also be selected from among the frontrunners in all three areas under consideration, including how to manage water stress, and how to improve access to at least basic drinking water and sanitation services. While conceptualising WASH defaults mainly to the household space, there is also a need to monitor WASH in non-household settings (Cronk et al., 2015 ), such as, among others, schools, healthcare facilities, workplaces, temporary use settings, mass gatherings and displaced populations, where health, education, welfare and productivity levels can be negatively affected by poor WASH facilities. This scenario is common in many developing and low-income regions of Africa. Refugees from war, political instability, and (more recently) from areas affected by general environmental decay and climate change, resort under displaced populations. Cronk et al. (2015)  maintain that governments have concentrated on monitoring WASH in the non-household settings of schools and healthcare facilities, while ignoring these latter spaces. The World Bank (Leigland et al., 2016 ) puts the monetary figure needed to attain the 2030 targets in respect of SDG 6 at US41.7 trillion. Existing funding sources fall far short of this. To raise funds for WASH and SDG 6, Leigland et al. (2016)  propose three possible sources: households (through tariff revenues and/or direct investment to provide self-financed WASH infrastructure), domestic taxpayers (through government subsidies) and, lastly, volunteer transfers (grants from donors and/or philanthropic foundations). Private and commercial funding is further identified, which can come from commercial banks, bonds, development banks and equity. Since commercial finance remains difficult to attract in the water and sanitation sector, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has called for the mobilisation of blended finance, in other words, “the strategic use of development finance and philanthropic funds to mobilise private capital flows to emerging and frontier markets” (Leigland et al., 2016 : 1). The domestic mobilisation of resources, mainly from national budgets, has been elevated through the United Nations' (2015b)  means of implementation call, made in July 2015 prior to the ratification of the 2030 agenda. In Hering's (2017)  view, managing water quality and wastewater remains a challenge, as many countries still have weak monitoring programmes. In the case of Malawi, Smiley (2017)  sampled 139 rural households in 13 villages and contacted Petrifilm water quality testing of 27 drinking water points. The main aim of that study was to confirm that the SDGs' proposed monitoring frameworks failed to make provision for matters related to water quality. The findings were that households make complex and often discrete water consumption decisions and, at times, draw water from unsafe sources. The households sampled revealed that they did not regularly use water treatments, with the common denominator being that they all stored some water. Such practices demand improved and regular water quality control at the household level, especially in rural settings. A study by Emenike et al. (2017) , in South-West Nigeria, sampled 400 households to determine their access to safe drinking water. The results revealed that water access was mainly limited to private sources due to issues around quality and accessibility. The researchers also found that government was failing its citizens, since water infrastructure had deteriorated drastically. The use of subsidies, cost recovery and rainwater harvesting were among the remedial actions recommended. Overall, in their study Sansom et al. (2018)  recorded rural households' access to piped water in SSA as being at five %. Hence, achieving the SDG 6 target of 100% will take a very long time.   5 Conclusion Drawing on the deliberations undertaken here, there is no doubt that the water and sanitation SDG remains at the centre of the 2030 AfSD, and that the broader public can benefit from its main findings. Clearly, African governments have achieved varying degrees of success in attempts to meet the water and sanitation SDGs. Financial and other resources, flowing from outside Africa's borders into the water and sanitation sector, remain limited, with marked declines noted during the global financial crisis of 2008. Hence, African governments and policymakers need to embark on a journey to shift their thinking and prioritise development trajectories related to water resources. Investments in WASH should be at the top of their list, especially as regards the domestic mobilisation of financial resources. Although there are many indicators on SDG 6, only three were discussed here, since many African countries did not have complete datasets for the other indicators. Generally, the findings confirm that, indeed, 2030 is too soon for Africa to achieve SDG 6. This implies that the continent must leapfrog to avoid being left behind when it comes to attaining universal water and sanitation access by 2030. Disturbing trends were observed in countries such as the Comoros and Zimbabwe, where declining trends in basic drinking water services were noted. Similar declining trends for basic sanitation services were noted in Chad, the DRC, Equatorial Guinea, the Gambia, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia and Zimbabwe. Although universal access to basic drinking water and sanitation services might be achieved, this is not a static indicator, as human settlements keep growing and water-related infrastructure continues to age. Universal access means keeping up with the maintenance of water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as growing populations. Lastly, universal access would also imply focusing on non-household WASH issues, and bringing appropriate non-water-based sanitation services to remote and rural African communities. Lessons from this study include the fact that the continent needs to realise that is still lags behind others in terms of WASH, and by default progress in achieving SDG 6 will be delayed. Countries such as Ethiopia have registered very slow progress in sanitation, while data on handwashing facilities for many countries is lacking. To this end, big data need to be generated to obtain and monitor information at the village level, including disaggregating indicators by gender. It is not only about big data, but also the quality and accessibility thereof. Going back to the main question: Is 2030 too soon for Africa to achieve the goal of sustainable development in respect of water and sanitation? The answer is: YES, indeed! However, Africa can and should channel additional domestic resources into WASH, to ensure that more of its residents enjoy the social and developmental benefits of universal access to drinking water and sanitation by 2030.
