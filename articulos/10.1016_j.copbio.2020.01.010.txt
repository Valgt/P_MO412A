                  Human population growth and accelerated climate change necessitate agricultural improvements using designer crop ideotypes (idealized plants that can grow in niche environments). Diverse and highly skilled research groups must integrate efforts to bridge the gaps needed to achieve international goals toward sustainable agriculture. Given the scale of global agricultural needs and the breadth of multiple types of omics data needed to optimize these efforts, explainable artificial intelligence (AI with a decipherable decision making process that provides a meaningful explanation to humans) and exascale computing (computers that can perform 1018 floating-point operations per second, or exaflops) are crucial. Accurate phenotyping and daily-resolution climatype associations are equally important for refining ideotype production to specific environments at various levels of granularity. We review advances toward tackling technological hurdles to solve multiple United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and discuss a vision to overcome gaps between research and policy.

six environmentally and socially oriented Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 2,4, 6, 7, 13 and 15). X-AI models bring together various omics datasets (including the epigenome, genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and phenome) of populations to understand their underlying biological mechanisms. A 200-petaflop supercomputer, Summit can perform 200 quadrillion (peta-) 64-bit floating point operations per second (-flops) and 3 × 1018 16-bit flops for vastly accelerated exascale data analytic and machine learning applications. Interpretable AI predictive models are essential to develop crop ideotypes that will thrive in target environments. These ideotypes can be precisely defined based on specific traits or trait combinations, including, but not limited to, water and nutrient use efficiency, high food or net energy yield per hectare, carbon sequestration, optimized microbiome usage, disease resistance, and so on.

Figure 1   Figure 2 Global climatype clustering. Examples of corresponding results and significant findings applying Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm to a network derived from the DUO similarity metric comparison of the climatype vectors with the use of increasing inflation values to give clusters of increasing granularities (a –d) . In order to determine what environments are present around the world at very high resolution 414 640 element tensors representing the environmental and climate conditions of each of the 157 million square kilometers of land on earth were created. By comparing all of these tensors to one another we have created a network that represents the similarity of all points on land to one another.  Figure 2   Figure 3 An illustration of how explainable artificial intelligence (X-AI)-based genomic selection can help with multi-criteria ideotype design. X-AI does not require traditional mathematics to combine datasets and this remains true for genomic selection with multi-criteria ideotype design. X-AI analyses can make smart interpretable decisions to link genotype to phenotype and genotype to climatype relationships showing the additive, epistatic, and pleiotropic combinations of specific alleles that lead to optimal crop phenotypes and climatype adaptation. SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms.  Figure 3   Figure 4 Strengthening the interface between science and policy for food and bioenergy sustainable development. A novel ‘three thirds’ approach for effective science-policy engagement is needed in order to scale new crop ideotype design and sustainable deployment. The three are interconnected and it is therefore important to understand how they fit together and influence one another, rather than viewing them in isolation.

Human population growth and accelerated climate change necessitate agricultural improvements using designer crop ideotypes (idealized plants that can grow in niche environments). Diverse and highly skilled research groups must integrate efforts to bridge the gaps needed to achieve international goals toward sustainable agriculture. Given the scale of global agricultural needs and the breadth of multiple types of omics data needed to optimize these efforts, explainable artificial intelligence (AI with a decipherable decision making process that provides a meaningful explanation to humans) and exascale computing (computers that can perform 1018  floating-point operations per second, or exaflops) are crucial. Accurate phenotyping and daily-resolution climatype associations are equally important for refining ideotype production to specific environments at various levels of granularity. We review advances toward tackling technological hurdles to solve multiple United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and discuss a vision to overcome gaps between research and policy.

All rights reserved.      Introduction In 2015, the international community committed to the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet, ensure global prosperity, and eradicate hunger [1 ]. Agriculture is globally recognized as critical to achieving the 2030 agenda [2 ,3 ], but it is also the greatest resource consumer [4 ,5 ], which can have substantial negative impacts on biodiversity, water, and global climate [6 ,7 ]. The development of novel sustainable crops with an optimal combination of traits that thrive in specific environments should be focused on food (SDG2) or bioenergy (SDG7) production, while conserving water resources (SDG6) and biodiversity (SDG15) like with multi-criteria ideotypes. Large-scale production of optimized cultivars will require technological advances in order to implement and integrate SDGs [8••  ]; while simultaneously minimizing environmental perturbations [9 ] and combating climate change (SDG13). Technological improvement of agricultural production from simple subsistence has been possible through mechanized advances, genomic breeding, and advanced phenotyping. Current efforts routinely integrate multi-omics datasets (genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, phytobiome, and phenome) of plant populations to dissect biological mechanisms that underlie desirable traits. Now we propose a next-generation agricultural revolution that hinges on artificial intelligence (AI), which will be essential for designing new crop ideotypes that are optimized for niche environments in a world with a rapidly changing climate while adhering to the SDGs mentioned above (Figure 1  ). AI has existed for decades but its popularity has increased with improvements in high performance computing (HPC). Put simply, AI, including machine learning approaches, utilize a variety of qualitative and quantitative data types, iteratively performing a series of calculations/decisions between vector sets followed by decision/action(s). AI is routinely used in complex, data-heavy sectors such as banking, business, and power grid management [10 ,11 ], and it can be a powerful tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping society adapt to a changing climate [12 ]. However, it is sometimes seen as a negative that many algorithms function as ‘black boxes’, that is, the decision making process is not known, and yet in many cases, the reasoning behind a solution is more informative than the solution itself [13••  ]. This agricultural revolution will require a systems-level approach (from individual plant to global scale) using exascale computing (the performance of a computer system reaches the exaflops level, that is, 1018  floating point operations per second), especially when ultra-fast mass brute force is required [14 ], and explainable AI (X-AI, AI with decipherable decision making process) methods to integrate and analyze multi-omics data layers (Figure 1 ). Educating and training early-career scientists and farmers (SDG4) will ultimately fuel the engines of future X-AI and exascale computing applied to plant biology and lead to the implementation of science-driven policies (Figure 1 ).  Securing sustainable food and bioenergy systems through plant population-scale multi-omics technologies Multiple omics technologies such as epigenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics are aimed primarily at the detection of methylation profiles, genes, mRNA, proteins, metabolites, and phenotypes, respectively. As compared to single omics, multi-omics studies offer the opportunity to understand the flow of information that underlies different types of environmental stresses. Crop yield increase has continuously relied on more detailed and accurate information for genotypes, phenotypes, and their local environments. In recent years the acquisition and implementation of multi-omics data reached unprecedented levels. Short-read sequencing made large populations genome level data easily accessible and economical for germline structural variations (variants), expression (RNA-seq), and epigenetics (DNA-methylation) [15 ], which is now being integrated with microfluidics to interrogate these genomic processes at the single cell level [16•  ,17 ]. Proteins are of paramount importance as the functional manifestation of genes; they are directly responsible for observable phenotypic traits, and protein variants can be engineered to modulate a desirable trait (e.g. disease resistance or growth). Advances in protein structure prediction methods along the past decade, combined with increased HPC, enable high-quality proteome-wide 3D-modeling [18 ]. Integrated systems biology models can subsequently predict protein-protein interactions, which can improve protein docking simulations to further provide structural information of protein complexes [19 ]. We are developing AI based docking protocols to screen 28 million small molecules against proteins associated with phenotypes (e.g. herbicide susceptibility). The 3D-interactome approach becomes the foundation for active compound discovery in other areas as well [20 ]. Finally, the components of the plant’s immediate environment (e.g. microbiome and ionome) and interactions among them greatly influence desired traits and are rapidly becoming readily accessible sources of informative data [21–23 ]. Exascale computing facilitates multi-omic layer integration to determine features that underlie traits of interest; a key to that goal is the addition of data-rich phenotypes — phenomics. Modernization of greenhouse and field-based high-throughput phenotyping and microphenotyping across large scales has been essential to capture the diverse traits needed to complement multi-omic AI predictions [24 ]. Various image processing modalities can non-invasively phenotype developmental and physiological phenotypes using broad light spectra [25 ,26 ]. For example, plant health and stress responses are quantifiable via red-green-blue (RGB) camera or true-color camera that can detect a signal and deliver it into three color bands: red, green, and blue. A genome-wide association study of drought tolerance of 507 rice accessions found 470 variants associated to 51 image-based traits captured through non-destructive RGB phenotyping [27 ]. Hyperspectral cameras detect hundreds of spectral bands with nm-level resolution between 350 and 2500 nm and can even detail: nitrogen content, physiology, water content, and biochemical traits from environmental stimuli and stress factor; for example, hyperspectral imaging data were used to detect maize plant response to direct insect herbivory as well as plant signaling between infested and non-infested individuals [28 ]. Thermal infrared (TIR) cameras can detect long-wave infrared radiation that is emitted by plant leaves based on temperature; for example, TIR imaging enabled effective assessment of genotype variability under drought stress conditions via leaf temperature and stomatal conductance in poplar breeding populations [29 ]. New phenotyping methods have been developed for profiling the root phenome (i.e. its structure and function), such as 3D-MRI, X-ray, tomography technology, and so on, which have a great potential in breeding for root traits [30•  ]. Additionally, plant photosynthetic performance can be estimated via kinetic chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. Aerial drones can automate phenotype imaging at individual or single-leaf resolution, and they are greenhouse-amenable and field-amenable. All these advances can play an important role in empowering plant biologists with accurate high-dimensional datasets to optimize the operational efficiencies of breeding programs. For example, in soybean, fusing machine learning-based analytics and optimization tools with phenomics data, complex relationships between phenomic traits and seed yield were mapped and their performance predicted [31 ]. Muti-scale phenomics provides enormous datasets and deep learning/feature extraction can capture specified and cryptic traits [32 ]. Current image analysis approaches implement segmentation (plant/background separation) and agglomerative whole plant summaries within images [33 ]. Therefore, substantial amounts of high-resolution, component-specific (e.g. leaves versus stalk) data are often not utilized. Development of AI-driven spatial feature extraction methods will create an unprecedented opportunity to integrate multi-omics results with data collected by automated phenotyping [34 ] and will underpin efforts to develop food and bioenergy crop ideotypes with improved climate resilience.  Environment genotype association and clustering the planet’s climatypes Gene by environment association (G × E or GEA) ― the interaction between genetic variation (heritability) and the environment to produce a given phenotype ― is important in crop breeding because the performance of a genotype can vary widely across environments, even over small scales [35–38 ]. Estimation of G × E is often done by simply rank-ordering genotypes in different environments or by calculating the spread of the expression of a target breeding value across environments [39 ]. The ability to rapidly generate high-resolution genome-level and phenome-level data under diverse environmental conditions will allow for more accurate and high-resolution G × E estimates to deploy crops that perform optimally across a broader set of environments. Currently, G × E estimation methods lack a true temporal component, thus, we developed genome-wide association time-series studies (GWATS) and periodic GEA (PGEA) to include daily resolution climate data from specific geographic locations for genomic associations (climatypes) (Streich et al. , unpublished). Historically, landscapes were classified by local plant morphology, and more recently with climate classes [40 ]. The current gold standard Koppen-Geiger system uses annual mean temperature and precipitation data with anthropocentric thresholds that define 31 climate classes. More recent efforts to cluster geography have focused on supervised machine learning algorithms with low resolution data or isolated regions [41 ]. However, an abundance of global temporal climate data exist for solar radiation, precipitation, temperature, and numerous other variables [42 ] that could vastly improve climatype definitions. Toward this end, we created global exascale datasets for 12 major elemental layers for soil and 48 light spectra (300 nm–780 nm) across 365 days and calculated similarity indexes using the DUO algorithm [22 ] on the Summit supercomputer. This generated climate clusters globally at 1 km2  resolution (Figure 2  ). With these data, the GWATS approach depicts spatio-temporal adaptation of candidate alleles, which can identify genotypes (cultivars, varieties) that optimally express a target phenotype at environmental granularities needed for sustainable, high-yield crop breeding. Researchers are currently using AI to find the most important multi-omic interactions and optimize outcomes [43•  ,44 ], but the addition of the complex environmental data presented here and new omics layers will result in an enormous feature-interaction space that will require exascale computing and newer AI approaches.  Explainable AI-assisted crop ideotype design for food security and bioenergy sustainability Multi-trait genomic selection is relatively a recent development and the use of Bayesian methods have been the most accurate, yet slow; recent AI methods have proven to be just as accurate with an increased speed giving them an edge over Bayesian models [45 ]. We draw on examples from machine-learning algorithms for scientific insights to show that newly developed X-AI algorithms [46 ] such as iterative Random Forest (iRF) can help identify phenotype-conveying variants using additive datasets, given genotype specific traits (Figure 3  ). X-AI can identify epistatic (the phenotypic effect of one gene can vary depending on the modifier gene) and pleiotropic (a single gene affects multiple phenotypic traits) relationships in dense variant sets while accounting for non-additive effects. The output accounts for all possible genome variants within the scope of targeted phenotypes such as yield or disease resistance, as well as climatypes (Figure 3 ). We believe X-AI can discover phenotypically superior high-yielding breeding pair combinations with other beneficial traits for consumption, energy production, and geo-targeted locations even on marginal land that is of poor quality and likely to be drought-prone, thus meeting both sustainability and agricultural needs.  Rethinking science-driven policy to enable ideotype deployment at scale Here we describe a novel three thirds approach for effective science-policy engagement to scale new crop ideotype design and sustainable deployment (Figure 4  ). The three third influences – entitled ‘aligning research with policy and practice’, ‘encouraging evidence-based policy making’, and ‘promoting science communication, public engagement and outreach’ are interconnected, thus it is important to understand how these factors fit together, influence one another, and as such, none can be viewed in isolation. The first third is critical to achieve SDGs and will require the integrated efforts of researchers, policymakers, breeders, landowners, and relevant stakeholders. This consortium can facilitate interdisciplinary research, co-design future projects and data analyses, encourage co-production of knowledge, evaluate sustainability trade-offs, and assess interactions among SDGs. Implementing innovations for agriculture-driven SDGs requires constructive participation by public and private sectors, non-governmental organizations, and philanthropic institutions, while meeting each organization’s individual priorities. The desired goal of the second third is to integrate scientific evidence in policy/decision-making processes for SDG success and future global food security. We believe enhancing credibility, responsibility, and transparency through science-policy engagement is a priority to overcome knowledge gaps and allow scientific advances to proceed ethically and with greater public confidence. Public trust is a crucial component in science-policy dynamics that positively impacts future science, policy, and society. The potential of scientific discoveries will not be fully realized until ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) [47 ] are addressed by effective science policy and communication. Scientists, policymakers and other stakeholders must redouble their efforts to extract more from ongoing research and innovation in bioenergy and food sustainability by measuring what matters (e.g. key performance indicators [KPIs]) and forecasting their impacts. The final third is to increase public knowledge and participation in science-related policymaking that will favorably impact the value of science to society. The best start for science students and early-career scientists wanting to increase their advocacy beyond the bench is getting involved in policy through education and capacity building. Sharing knowledge is imperative for the cross-pollination of ideas and practices that influence students; science communication is an integral part of doing research. Storytelling and narratives [48 ,49 ], as well as creativity in scientific writing [50 ,51•  ], can help connect science to non-experts and present engaging discoveries to the public. Museums of science and innovation, science festivals, games, simulations, and avant-garde outreach [52 ] can also boost public understanding that will ultimately increase public receptiveness to science.  Conclusions In the face of a changing climate it will be necessary to design food and bioenergy crop ideotypes that thrive in future environments at microscale levels. An AI-driven paradigm shift is significantly transforming plant omics and breeding research. At present, large amounts of multi-omics, imaging, ecophysiology, and field-based data are becoming available for large-scale population-level studies, revealing subtle differences in plants’ genetic-based adaptation potential and allowing design interventions. Advanced AI approaches can be used to model climatype patterns and clustering across the last 50 years against the backdrop of carbon dioxide levels in an effort to predict future patterns. This will be used to predict future climatype patterns that can be targets for new ideotypes to optimize agricultural productivity and sustainability. Rapid progress in these areas will be indispensable for future innovation in plant biotechnology and AI-driven crop ideotypes design. It is critical that researchers and policymakers integrate and promote their efforts to deliver SDG solutions [8••  ] while efficiently and clearly communicating these to society.
