                  The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have 17 Goals, 169 Targets and 232 Indicators. The fourth specific target of SDG11 (Target 11.4) is “Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage”. Target 11.4 identifies the important role of conservation and preservation of natural and cultural heritage for sustainable development. World heritage exists in different countries and regions with different cultural backgrounds and development levels. Because of the complexity of the system, the evaluation method based on objective system becomes a difficult problem. The in-depth interpretation of the target system, reliable data and measurement are essential for transforming SDGs into practical tools for solving problems. Based on the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV), authenticity and integrity requirements of world heritage, this paper puts forward the scientific conception of SDG11.4 index decomposition and advocates the quantitative method of indicators. This paper suggests that the indicator given by Target 11.4 for the SDGs should be summarized as 11.4.1 “Increasing investment in protecting and defending the world’s cultural and natural heritage”. Two additional indicators are added, one is 11.4.2 “Increase investment in science and technology to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage”, the other is 11.4.3 “Increase education and publicity to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage”. This can fully reflect the role of education, science and culture in “further efforts to protect and safeguard world cultural and natural heritage”.

This can fully reflect the role of education, science and culture in “further efforts to protect and safeguard world cultural and natural heritage”.   Keywords: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  World Heritage  Evaluation  Quantification    1 Research Background In 1972, the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) adopted the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (hereinafter referred to as the Convention) at its 17th General Conference held in Paris. The Convention aims at recognizing, protecting, preserving, displaying and passing on from generation to generation the cultural and natural heritage of outstanding universal value (UNESCO, 1972 ). The Convention is the most intelligent call of mankind in the 20th century. It has received a positive response from all over the world. At present, 195 countries and regions are contracting members. The Convention is of great significance to the promotion of the outstanding universal value of the World Heritage and the protection of its authenticity and integrity. Since the adoption of the Convention in 1972, the international community has fully accepted the concept of “Sustainable Development”. Protecting and preserving natural and cultural heritage is a great contribution to sustainable development. On September 25, 2015, at the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, 193 Member States formally adopted The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which defines 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 sub-goals for the next 15 years. The content involves three levels of sustainable development for society, economy and environment (UN, 2015 ). Sustainable development is the result of human reflection on the process of industrial civilization. It is a new concept of development, morality and civilization. It is a development theory and strategy based on the protection of the natural resources and environment, under the condition of stimulating economic development, aiming at improving the quality of human life. It involves many aspects, such as nature, environment, society, economy, science and technology, politics and so on. It requires that development should be coordinated and adapted with resources, environment and population. The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) led the global framework of the sustainable development goals, including 17 SDGs and 169 Targets. Based on the work of the Inter-agency Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs), 232 specific indicators have been formulated (UNSD 2018 ). IAEG-SDGs further divide these indicators into three levels according to the consistency of quantitative criteria and calculation methods of indicators and the difficulty of data acquisition (Sachs et al., 2016 ). Among the 17 SDGs, Goal 11 is “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. The goal includes seven direct targets and three indirect targets. Target 11.4 puts forward “Further efforts to protect and defend the world cultural and natural heritage”, which includes one indicator, belonging to Tier III. There is still no data and no method (IAEG-SDGs, 2018 ). With the support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), the Bertelsmann Foundation has released SDGs Index for 34 countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The SDGs Index was mainly used to track the progress of implementing SDGs in 34 OECD countries in a simplified way and to identify development issues that need to be addressed as a priority (Kroll, 2015 ). In addition, the UK Overseas Development Institute (ODI) has also done valuable work, providing a scorecard to evaluate sustainable development goals, reflecting the development trend of SDG core dimensions in different regions, and proposing areas to be improved and improved urgently (Nicolai et al., 2016 ). Through the scorecard, it is found that conventional strategies and measures cannot achieve most of the goals of SDGs. The scorecard of ODI mainly depends on the aggregation of regional indicators, so some conclusions are not applicable to the national level. In 2017, SDSN and the Bertelsmann Foundation jointly provided SDGs indices and indicators based on the national level, identified priority areas for each country and priority areas for development. SDGs Index and indicator board mainly focus on the situation of each country, cannot solve the problem of unbalanced development among regions, there are many indicators spillover effect has not been considered. As pointed out by the Statistical Commission of the Economic and Social Council at its forty-seventh session on the data and indicators of the Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030: In some cases, the proposed indicators do not cover all aspects of a particular goal and its specific objectives. It is expected that the methods will be further refined with a view to continually improving indicators and enhancing data collection to remedy these shortcomings (UN E/CN, 2016 ). The index system and quantification method of Target 11.4 were discussed in this paper. The purpose is to analyze the connotation of Target 11.4, establish a decomposition system of the SDG 11, and to provide a set of appropriate and convenient measurement methods for different countries and regions. so as to better understand the status of global heritage resources and better protect heritage.  2 Decomposition System for Target 11.4 Generally, there are three levels from Goals to Targets and then to Indicators. Target 11.4 is relatively independent from Goal 11 of the Sustainable Development Goals. To address this problem, it is recommended that Target 11.4 has been divided into 3 Indicators. And every Indicator is divided into several Sub-Indicators to quantify “Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage”. Then the goal system is divided into four levels by Goal - Target - Indicator – Sub-Indicator. UN proposed “Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage” as Target 11.4. So far, an indicator has given, “Total expenditure (public and private) per capita spent on the preservation, protection and conservation of all cultural and natural heritage, by type of heritage (cultural, natural, mixed and World Heritage Centre designation), level of government (national, regional and local/municipal), type of expenditure (operating expenditure/investment) and type of private funding (donations in kind, private non-profit sector and sponsorship)”. According to the relevant terms and contents of the Convention, the given indicator does not fully meet the responsibility of Target 11.4. Therefore, the given indicator can be summarized as 11.4.1 “increase capital investment to protect the world’s cultural and natural heritage”. In addition, two additional indicators are added. One is 11.4.2 “Increase investment in science and technology to protect and safeguard the world cultural and natural heritage”, the other is 11.4.3 “Increase education and publicity to protect and safeguard the world cultural and natural heritage”.  Figure 1  shows the target decomposition diagram.  3 The connotation interpretation and the computational method of Indicator 11.4.1 3.1 The connotation interpretation Indicator 11.4.1 is “Increase capital investment to protect and safeguard the world cultural and natural heritage”. And the Report of the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators (2018)  also points out that “Total expenditure (public and private) per capita spent on the preservation, protection and conservation of all cultural and natural heritage, by type of heritage (cultural, natural, mixed and World Heritage Centre designation), level of government (national, regional and local/municipal), type of expenditure (operating expenditure/investment) and type of private funding (donations in kind, private non-profit sector and sponsorship).” As seen above, heritage types can be divided into cultural, natural, mixed and World Heritage Centre designation. In terms of funds which can be divided into two categories: source and expenditure. The source of funding includes two types: one is the level of government (national, regional and local/municipal), and the other is the type of private funding (donations in kind, private non-profit sector and sponsorship). The expenditure of funding includes operating expenditure and investment. The item of expenditure should consider the total expenditure (public and private), total operating expenditure, total investment expenditure and total expenditure per capita (public and private). In addition to Investment in level of government (national, regional and local/municipal), it is necessary to consider the operation income from heritage sites, such as tourism and other business activities.  Figure 2  shows the decomposition diagram of Indicator 11.4.1.  3.2 Quantitative Methods “Total per capita expenditure (public and private) spent on the preservation, protection and conservation of all cultural and natural heritages” has been required to be calculated according to the Report of the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators (2018) . The amount of total per capita expenditure in a country is at least related to the following factors:(1) the amount of all the cultural and natural heritage in the country;  (2) the amount of money invested in each cultural and natural heritage;  (3) the number of people in the country.    Therefore, the following aspects should be considered in this indicator:(1) “Total per capita expenditure” does not reflect whether the country “Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage” or not. Although there is an upward trend in per capita expenditure in time series, it is not easy to make horizontal comparisons between countries.  (2) Need to refine the investment of each heritage.  (3) It is necessary to assign and weigh different types of expenditure according to the local conditions of different countries, which also reflects the country-based program.  (4) Measuring capital input or expenditure can also be calculated from the perspective of protected areas. It can be expressed by dividing capital by protected area.    Taking Huangshan Mountain as an example, the research group demonstrated the feasibility of the index system and evaluation method of indicator 11.4.1. Huangshan Mountain was listed on the World Heritage List as the 17th dual heritage project, at the 14th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, held in Banff, Canada, in December 1990 (Fang, 2004 ). In 2004, Huangshan was selected as Global Geopark (Han, Wu, Tian, Li & Jiang, 2016 ). Huangshan was also approved as China’s 34th World Biosphere Reserve in 2018 (Huangshan Management Committee, 2018 ). As a heritage site in multiple UNESCO lists, Huangshan is an ideal test site for SDGs. In collaboration with the Huangshan Management Committee, the research group sorted out the subjects of revenue and expenditure of funds for the mixed heritage sites of Huangshan from 1990 to 2017, and proposed index system and evaluation method of the indicator 11.4.1. For Huangshan World Cultural and Natural Heritage Site, we quantified “increasing capital investment in protecting natural and cultural heritage” from two aspects of source and expenditure when evaluating the indicator 11.4.1. It makes up for the limitation that the original index only reflects the indicator from the total per capita expenditure. Source can be divided into two categories, the one is national input and the other is miscellaneous revenues. The sum of the two is total income. Expenditure is divided into business expenditure and investment expenditure. Add the two together as total expenditure. Then, experts score and assign weights for each sub-indicators as the basis of evaluation. Generally speaking, the investment of funds can reflect the protection of Huangshan’s increasing efforts to some extent. But it cannot completely and accurately reflect the degree of such efforts and the benefits it produces. The specific content will be discussed in another article.   4 Conclusion and expectation It is undeniable that the SDGs are very complex agendas for different countries and regions. As far as Target 11.4 for SDG is concerned, changes and innovations are needed in the future for sustainable heritage protection. World Heritage is faced with such problems as the growing imbalance between development and conservation, urban expansion and environmental degradation. There is an urgent need for countries to take action to monitor sustainable development goals for a long time, assess progress in implementation, identify problems and ensure sustainable development of the World Heritage Site on the right path. In this paper, the decomposition system of Target 11.4 and the evaluation method of indicator 11.4.1 are discussed. Further efforts are needed to improve indicator 11.4.2 and 11.4.3. Indicator 11.4.1 elaborates on increasing capital investment to protect and defend heritage. Indicator 11.4.2 is elaborated from the perspective of strengthening the protection of natural and cultural heritage by science and technology. Although some of the investment in science and technology may be reflected in the form of funds in the indicator 11.4.1, it mainly emphasizes the investment in science and technology related to management in indicator 11.4.2. Especially on the basis of relevant scientific and technological requirements, we select indicators from UNESCO’s management content which has specific requirements in the Convention Guidelines. Indicator 11.4.3 emphasizes strengthening education and propaganda to protect and safeguard the world cultural and natural heritage. As mentioned above, this study is only in the preliminary stage, and has not yet constructed a complete and detailed index system for the Target. In order to fully and accurately reflect the great efforts made by various countries in the field of heritage protection, it is necessary to discuss and study together. In the future, we will continue to carry out relevant research to promote the sustainable development of World Heritage and other SDGs, and look forward to achieving a comprehensive and perfect sustainable development index and related indicators system of World Heritage.
