                  Global efforts to accomplish net zero carbon emission are implausible without attaining Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, which pertains to facilitating access to clean energy sources. Despite numerous initiatives, 2.9 billion people, mostly from South Asia and Africa, are without access to clean cooking fuel. The current study uses Demographic and Household Survey (DHS) Data from 46 developing countries and employs probit regression and decision trees to examine access to clean cooking energy and its determinants. The result shows that clean cooking fuel usage is low in Sub-Saharan Africa and a few countries in Asia. The study also finds that education, wealth, urban residency, and gender are crucial determinants of clean cooking fuel usage. As is the case, global efforts to provide clean fuel access to all and achieve net zero carbon emission require large-scale investment; the clean energy transition policy requires accentuating the improvement of access through supplies and the enhancement of the education and income of the household, especially in rural areas.

Despite numerous initiatives, 2.9 billion people, mostly from South Asia and Africa, are without access to clean cooking fuel. The current study uses Demographic and Household Survey (DHS) Data from 46 developing countries and employs probit regression and decision trees to examine access to clean cooking energy and its determinants. The result shows that clean cooking fuel usage is low in Sub-Saharan Africa and a few countries in Asia. The study also finds that education, wealth, urban residency, and gender are crucial determinants of clean cooking fuel usage. As is the case, global efforts to provide clean fuel access to all and achieve net zero carbon emission require large-scale investment; the clean energy transition policy requires accentuating the improvement of access through supplies and the enhancement of the education and income of the household, especially in rural areas.   Keywords Developing countries  Clean cooking fuel  Sustainable development goal  SDG7  Wealth  Education  Rural  Net zero  Carbon emissions    1 Introduction Clean cooking fuel is a critical element for the upliftment of health and well-being of families in developing countries. Clean fuel avoids direct contact with solid fuel emissions that cause various diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases). Also, it prevents children’s exposure to household air pollution that results in low birth weight, acute respiratory infections, anemia, and premature mortality (Ali et al., 2021; Khan et al., 2017 ). This specifically impacts women as they are primarily responsible for cooking and gathering fuel and wood. Although there is an increase in access to clean cooking fuel from 6.1 billion people in 2000–10.7 billion in 2017, 2.9 billion people still lack access to clean cooking fuel (United Nations, 2020 ). This divide stems from poor access and unaffordability (Bonjour et al., 2013; WLPGA, 2019 ). Poor access and unaffordability force a significant pocket of developing countries’ populations to rely on firewood, cow dung, and kerosene oil for cooking. The emission of harmful particles and gases from these alternative fuels leaves a detrimental effect on human health and the dwelling environment (Bruce et al., 2000; de Koning et al., 1985; Ezzati and Kammen, 2002; Fullerton et al., 2008; Jerneck and Olsson, 2013; Lelieveld et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 1999; Rahut et al., 2017a); Smith, 1993; WLPGA, 2018 ). Excessive extraction of biomass and firewood for cooking causes deforestation, resulting in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contributes to global warming. Consequently, it damages the ecosystem in the long run and alters biodiversity (Akpalu et al., 2011; Duflo et al., 2008 ). Considering the stress on the dwelling environment, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG7) emphasises access to clean and affordable energy sources for all by 2030 (United Nations, 2020 ). However, the paucity of supply and higher costs of cleaner cooking fuel alternatives still force a considerable portion of the population in various developing nations to consider solid dirty fuels for cooking as an alternative energy source (Behera et al., 2015; Mottaleb et al., 2017; Rahut et al., 2019, 2020; Rahut et al., 2014 ). Therefore, energy affordability remains a significant cause for concern. In this framework, the Energy Ladder Hypothesis (Leach, 1992 ) establishes that households shift to use cleaner fuels such as electricity and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) as their income increases (Leach, 1992; Masera et al., 2000; Nansaior et al., 2011; Rahut et al., 2019 ). Various studies support this hypothesis by establishing a positive association between income and clean cooking fuel usage (Hou et al.,; Karimu, 2015; Özcan et al., 2013; Rahut et al., 2017c, 2017d, 2017e ). In the context of affordability, relative fuel prices also impact the decision about types of fuel usage (Farsi et al., 2007; Mensah and Adu, 2015 ). Moreover, the relative price and the volume of the biomass and firewood collection are conditional on the opportunity cost of collection (this includes easy access and fuel cost). Furthermore, the opportunity cost of fuel collection is also conditional on the household’s demographic composition and education level, which positively affect clean fuel usage (Heltberg, 2005; Pachauri and Jiang, 2008; Pandey and Chaubal, 2011; Rao and Reddy, 2007; Reddy and Srinivas, 2009 ). Although in developing countries, in general, women control fuel collection and usage, there is an absence of unanimity among researchers regarding the direction of the relationship between cooking fuel use and the gender of the head of the household (Muller and Huijie, 2014; Muller and Huijie, 2016 ). Some studies argue that even as de facto female-headed households use clean cooking oil, de jure female-headed households mostly rely on dirty fuel (Aryal et al., 2019 ). Therefore, there is a lack of unidirectional association between cooking fuel usage and various factors across different countries, which calls for understanding the determinants of clean energy usage for policy formulation. The existing studies mostly pertain to specific geographic regions and often fall short of suggesting a global policy framework. The current study uses Demographic and Household Survey (DHS) Data from 46 developing countries, and a probit model to examine access to clean cooking energy and its determinants. This first novelty of the study comes from the fact that it uses datasets collected using similar instruments and methodology across 46 developing countries. Second, this study uses large household datasets, which makes it unique in its own right. This study also uses decision tree analysis to complement probit regression analysis, which we believe is not available in existing literature. One caveat of this study for comparability is that it was not collected in the same years. The structure of the study is as follows. The objectives are discussed in Section 2 ; the methods and econometric estimation procedure in Section 3 ; the major findings in Section 4 ; and the discussion, conclusion, and policy implications in Section 5 .  2 Literature review Numerous studies assess households’ fuel choices and consumption patterns in various dimensions. However, these studies focus on four major aspects: income and wealth, education level of the household head and spouse, the household’s demographic structure, household location (rural versus urban), and fuel choice. 2.1 Wealth and income and fuel usage pattern Leach’s energy ladder hypothesis discusses the switch from solid fuels to cleaner alternatives (e.g., LPG, electricity) due to an increase in income (Pachauri et al., 2004; Rao and Reddy, 2007 ). In the case of Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Pakistan, studies support this hypothesis by establishing a positive relationship between wealth, income, and clean cooking fuel usage (Aryal et al., 2019; Khandker et al., 2012; Yasmin and Grundmann, 2019 ). Further, as nonfarm employment is expected to generate higher income, studies indicate a positive role of nonfarm employment in clean energy usage (Lin and Zhao, 2021 ). Moreover, households engaged in nonfarm employment are likely to have comparatively higher education, which is also expected to impact energy source switching.  2.2 Education and the fuel use pattern The level of education exhibits households’ enhanced awareness regarding pollution. Many studies corroborate a positive association between schooling and clean energy adoption and a negative association between schooling and dirty fuel usage (Hou et al., 2017; Hou et al., 2019; Joshi and Bohara, 2017; Karimu, 2015; Liao et al., 2019; Makonese et al., 2017; Muller and Huijie, 2014; Muller and Huijie, 2016 ; Rahut et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2017d ). To an extent in this context, researchers show an increasing reliance on LPG and electricity due to the increasing education level of the household head (Huang, 2015; Makonese et al., 2017; Mensah and Adu, 2015; Rao and Reddy, 2007 ). However, the household head and the person responsible for fuel use may differ, and their respective genders can impact decision-making. Regarding the impact of education on gender in deciding the fuel types, a study by Pandey and Chaubal (2011)  shows a positive correlation between the number of educated female members and clean energy usage. As mentioned above, since women largely control energy usage and collection in a household, researchers examine and empirically establish a positive relationship between gender and clean energy use (Ekholm et al., 2010; Farsi et al., 2007; Faye, 2002; Heltberg, 2004; Ouedraogo, 2006; Rahut et al., 2017c ). Due to their education levels and opportunity costs of collecting solid fuels, households headed by working professionals prefer clean and non-traditional fuel as a time-saving option (Mottaleb et al., 2017; Rahut et al., 2020; Rao and Reddy, 2007 ). Therefore, education prompts fuel switching (Heltberg, 2005; Pachauri, 2004; Pachauri and Jiang, 2008 ), leading to a higher usage of clean fuel usage. Moreover, time-saving clean energy fuel also, in turn, allows more time for education (Heltberg, 2004; Hou et al., 2019; Mottaleb et al., 2017; Rahut et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2016b, 2017c, 2017e ).  2.3 Demographic composition/gender of household head and fuel choice As per existing literature, the household head and number of educated female members impact fuel choice; therefore, the gender composition of the household is expected to influence fuel choice. A higher number of females and children members in a family offers an advantage in collecting firewood, reducing the motivation to switch to modern energy sources (Heltberg, 2005 ). Therefore, improving females’ socioeconomic status is more likely to dissuade them from using solid fuels (Israel, 2002 ), and consequently, gender composition plays a significant role in switching to renewable energy (Farhar, 1998 ). The severity of the impact of gender composition on fuel choice in a household depends on the family demographics (size, age, and gender composition) (Heltberg, 2004; Joshi and Bohara, 2017; Kuo and Azam, 2019; Liao et al., 2019; Rahut et al., 2019 ). In this regard, numerous studies (Dewees, 1989; Heltberg et al., 2000; Nepal et al., 2011; Pandey and Chaubal, 2011 ) establish a negative relationship between household size and clean fuel usage as a bigger family expects to have a large labor force for collecting firewood, which reduces the incentives to switch to clean energy sources. However, the professional affiliation of household members determines the availability of the labor force and plays a crucial role in fuel choice. Especially, agricultural families prefer solid fuels4  4 Households use the byproducts of agricultural households such as crop residue and cow dung as solid fuels.   for cooking because of their easy access and availability (Ma et al., 2019; Rahut et al., 2016a ), whereas nonfarm employment of a member of the household is likely to support the use of clean cooking fuel as the opportunity cost of collection is high (Ma et al., 2019 ).  2.4 Spatial determinants of fuel choice The spatial dimension in terms of the geographical locations of the household tends to influence fuel choice through access and socioeconomic conditions of the location. There is significant spatial variation in the prevalence of fuel usage across and within developing countries (Azanaw and Chanie, 2023; Khavari et al., 2023; Azanaw and Melaku, 2023 ). Moreover, depending on the geographical location, lack of access to clean fuel forces households in remote and rural areas to use biomass as their primary source of cooking fuel. The far-flung households near the forest find firewood cheap and accessible (Makonese et al., 2017; Pallegedara et al., 2021; Rahut et al., 2014, 2016a ). Therefore, energy usage is also conditional on the spatial location of the user.  2.5 Issues of fuel staking The lack of access and affordability lead to the inadequacy of a single source to meet the required energy, and forces households in developing countries to rely on multiple fuel sources. This inadequacy leads to energy staking. In developing countries, this energy staking inhibits fuelwood use but does not replace it completely with LPG (Masera et al., 2000 ). Therefore, over time, households alter their secondary source as the primary source and continue to use conventional fuel as a negligible share of the total energy basket. Currently, 33 per cent of the global energy consumption is attributed to the manufacturing sector, and 29 per cent is accounted for by household consumption. Moreover, in developing countries, solid fuels constitute 90 per cent of household energy (International Energy Agency, 2006 ), resulting in households being the third-largest emitting source of CO2  (i.e., 21 per cent) (International Energy Agency, 2008 ). Undeniably, the proper switching, embracing, and consumption of clean fuels can significantly enhance the standard of living by curbing GHG emissions and air pollution. In addition to the switching, forest conservation helps decrease CO2  emissions by carbon sequestration. The current study’s findings can favor policy formulation for developing countries, ensuring access to clean fuel for all by 2030. In light of the above literature review, this study will significantly contribute to the existing literature and energy transition for net zero carbon emissions through the use of large, harmonized household data from several developing countries and robust methodology.   3 Data and methodology 3.1 Data and sampling This study uses the cross-sectional Demographic Health Survey (DHS) data collected between 2010 and 2019 from 46 developing countries. After cleaning the data and dropping the missing variable, we used a total sample of 1264,292 observations.5  5 The distribution of the sample used in the studies are as follows: Afghanistan (2015)- 23,374; Bangladesh (2017)- 19,402; Cambodia (2014)-15,775; India (2016)- 597,320; Indonesia (2017)- 47,312; Kyrgyzstan (2012)- 8032; Nepal (2016)- 11,001; Philippines (2017)- 27,327; Pakistan (2017)- 14,448; Tajikistan (2017)- 6257; Timor Leste (2016)- 11,488; Angola (2015)- 15,645; Burkina Faso (2010)- 11,300; Benin (2017)- 13,750; Chad (2014)- 12,944; Congo DR (2013)- 9376; Congo (2011)- 11,324; Comoros (2012)- 2614; Cote d′Ivoire (2011)- 8928; Cameroon (2018)- 11,156; Ethiopia (2019)- 7167; Gabon (2012)- 9286; Gambia (2019)- 5731; Ghana (2014)- 11,366; Guinea (2018)- 7793; Kenya (2014)- 35,682; Liberia (2018)- 8828; Lesotho (2014)- 9211; Mali (2018)- 9299; Malawi (2015)- 26,136; Nigeria (2018)- 39,731; Namibia (2013)- 9726; Rwanda (2019)- 12,887; Sierra Leone (2019)- 7183; Senegal (2019)- 4198; Uganda (2016)- 17,796; Zambia (2018)- 6979; Zimbabwe (2015)- 10,421; Albania (2017)- 15,765; Armenia (2015)- 5913; Colombia (2015)- 32,553; Dominican Republic (2013)- 10,710; Guatemala (2014)- 21,271; Honduras (2011)- 20,833; Haiti (2016)-13,181; Peru (2012)- 25,873.   DHS is nationally representative data based on a multi-stage sampling process. The first step consists of the enumeration areas, or the selection of the primary sampling unit; selection of households is the second step. After collecting the data, DHS and the respective governments conduct an ethical review of the responses. The details of this sampling method are available on the DHS website (https://www.dhsprogram.com/data/ ) .  3.2 Econometrics model 3.2.1 Probit model In this study, we employ the probit model to estimate the factors influencing the use of clean cooking fuel separately for 46 countries. In our model, the dependent variable primary cooking fuel  (E) is a binary variable, where E ∈ 0,1      , with E = 1   , if households use clean cooking fuel, 0   otherwise. We calculate the probability of a household using clean cooking fuel Pr ⁡ ( E = 1 )    using the equation:P r ( E = 1 ) = θ ∑ k = 1  K  β  k   X  k          In our model, the estimated two events from disjoint sets are complementary as the response is a binary outcome. The probability of the alternative event (i.e., not using clean cooking fuel) is:   Pr E = 0   = 1 − θ ∑ k = 1  K  β k  X k            The partial derivative with respect to the independent variable X  K      of the above equation represents the marginal effect as:      ∂ P r o b E = 1    ∂ X k     = θ  ′  ∑ k = 1  K  β k  X k    * β k          The probability of the i  th     household using, P  i   = P ( E = 1 )   , depends on a set of explanatory variables, X  i 1   … … . , X  ik     E = α + β X  i   + ε ;    ε  is  random  error  term         The outcome variable primary cooking fuel is considered clean if the household uses liquid petroleum gas (LPG), biogas, and electricity. Wood, animal dung, agricultural residue/waste, straw/shrubs/grass, kerosene, coal/lignite, and charcoal are considered dirty cooking fuel. The variable clean cooking fuel is binary in nature: 1 if the primary cooking fuel of the household is clean and 0 if it is dirty. Based on existing literature and the availability of the variables in the datasets of all the countries, we selected the following explanatory or independent variables. Age of the household:  As the age of the household tends to play a significant role in influencing the household decision to use clean fuel, we used this factor in our probit model to examine the determinants of clean cooking fuel use. With the increase in the age of the household head, the household may tend to use clean cooking fuel for convenience, as the accumulation of wealth may also support it. Meanwhile, an older household head may tend to use traditional fuel and not switch to clean fuel. Therefore, the impact of age on fuel switching could be mixed. Gender of the household head:  As females are responsible for cooking and collecting fuelwood, a female household head tends to switch to cleaner energy as it would reduce the burden on the female members and children in the household. In our probit model, we use the female head dummy, which gets a value of 1 if the household is headed by a female; otherwise, it is 0. Household size:  This represents the labor force available for collecting the fuelwood and biomass. Therefore, households with more family members tend to rely on dirty fuel and are relatively less likely to switch to clean cooking fuel. The household size is a continuous variable and represents the number of members in the household. Economic status:  As highlighted in the literature cited above, economic status plays a critical role in energy transition. We used the wealth index dummy as a proxy for economic status. The households are divided into three categories: poor (base category), middle, and rich. Education level:  We used the education level dummy as a crucial determinant of the clean cooking fuel transition. In our estimation, there are four categories of the level of education: illiterate (base category), primary, secondary, and tertiary. Location of the household (rural/urban):  As rural households have limited access to clean fuel and are also economically poor with easy access to biomass such as straw, firewood, and dung cake, we use the rural dummy as the explanatory variable.  3.2.2 Decision tree To present the profile of study participants, the study uses univariate analysis, classification, and regression tree analysis. Decision tree analysis aims to identify the highly influential and critical factors in determining the outcome variables. Decision tree analysis can complement probit regression by providing additional insights into the data, identifying non-linear relationships and interactions, assessing the importance of variables, and offering a more interpretable model. By combining the strengths of both approaches, this study aims to enhance understanding of the relationships between predictors and the outcome variable (clean cooking fuel). The decision tree splits the data into two segments that are as homogeneous as possible regarding the dependent variables and ends at the terminal node at which all outcome variables have the same value for all cases. This terminal node is also known as a homogeneous node or pure node. Since the large numbers of predictor variables limit the accuracy of the parametric method, this study uses the non-parametric classification and regression tree method under the recursive partitioning principle to deal with the complex interaction among those large numbers of predictors. Since the decision tree method deals with each predictor separately, and splits a new predictor recursively into two mutually exclusive groups each time, the dimension reduction technique is redundant. After identifying the relevant variables in the decision tree model, the study focuses on calculating the importance of the independent variable. A variable importance score is the improvement measure attributed to each variable as a primary or surrogate splitter; therefore, it measures the change in the network’s model-predicted value.    4 Descriptive analysis 4.1 Prevalence of use of clean cooking fuel  Fig. 1  shows that clean cooking fuel usage is very low in developing countries, with wide variation within and across countries. In Asian countries under study, clean fuel as a primary source of cooking fuel is as low as 9.2 per cent in Timor-Leste, while it is 67 per cent in Indonesia, 74.2 per cent in Kyrgyzstan, and 87.8 per cent in Tajikistan. This high variation may stem from the data, as the collection procedure does not match the same year. Therefore, due to this high variation, the successful implementation of SDG7 (i.e., universal access to clean and affordable energy sources) remains challenging. African countries in this study also show similar estimates regarding clean fuel as a primary source. In several countries, less than 12 per cent of households use clean cooking fuel, except in Senegal (18.1 per cent), Ghana (21 per cent), Namibia (29.8 per cent), Lesotho (32.2 per cent), Zimbabwe (35 per cent), Angola (40.3 per cent), and Gabon (60 per cent). Therefore, the usage of clean cooking fuel is unacceptably low and far below the SDG7 target. In contrast, clean cooking fuel use in Europe is very high: Armenia (95.9 per cent) and Albania (69.8 per cent). The same is true for most Latin American and the Caribbean countries under study, but variation is remarkably high; for instance, Colombia and the Dominican Republic show more than 84 per cent usage, while Haiti shows only 3.6 per cent. Therefore, although a few countries are at the forefront of clean fuel usage, others are still at a nascent stage. This lower usage of clean fuel hindrances the process of reducing air pollution and GHG emissions to enhance the health and well-being of society. Therefore, an enormous effort is required to enable households in developing countries to switch to clean cooking fuel.  4.2 Gender and clean energy use Numerous studies examine the relationships between gender and energy usage. Appendix 1 shows the relationship between the household head’s gender and the use of clean cooking fuel. Among some Asian countries, namely Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, and Timor-Leste, there is not much variance in the impact of gender of the household on clean cooking fuel usage. Whereas in Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Philippines, and Tajikistan, the percentage of female-headed households using clean cooking fuel is higher than that of male-headed households. Interestingly, in Tajikistan, female-headed and male-headed households using clean cooking fuel are 91.5 per cent and 86.7 per cent, respectively; while in Afghanistan, the statistics for female-headed and male-headed households are 32.5 per cent and 27.2 per cent, respectively. However, this apparent higher percentage of female-headed households using clean cooking fuel results from a lower share of female-headed households in total households.6  6 In case of Afghanistan, female-headed households are only 1.62 per cent of all households.   Moreover, female-headed households using clean cooking fuel are lower than male-headed households in Indonesia, Nepal, and Pakistan. In Indonesia, 61.2 per cent of households are female-headed, of which 68.1 per cent use clean cooking fuel; clean cooking fuel usage in Nepal by female-headed and male-headed households is 38.5 per cent and 43.9 per cent, respectively; in Pakistan, the statistics for female-headed and male-headed are 45.7 per cent and around 49.7 per cent, respectively. Among African countries under study, the use of clean fuel is extremely low in Burkina Faso, Benin, Chad, Comoros, Congo DR, Congo, Gambia, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and Zambia. As a result, the difference in the use of clean fuel among male- and female-headed households is low or non-existent. One of the reasons for the low usage of clean fuel may be the lower per capita income. Appendix 1 also shows that in Gabon, Angola, Ghana, Lesotho, and Zimbabwe, the percentage of female-headed households using clean cooking fuel is lower than that of male-headed households. Among these countries, in Gabon, 56.2 per cent of female-headed households and 61.9 per cent of male-headed households use clean cooking fuel, which is more than in other African countries. In Namibia, 30.9 per cent of female-headed households and 29.3 per cent of male-headed households, and in Senegal, 24.0 per cent of female-headed households and 15.8 per cent of male-headed households use clean cooking fuel. In contrast, Ghana shows that only 18.9 per cent of female-headed households, in comparison with 22 per cent of male-headed households, use clean cooking fuel. In contrast to Asian and African countries, clean cooking fuel usage is high among European and Latin American countries, and more female-headed households use clean cooking fuel than male-headed households. Among the European and Latin American countries under study, Armenia has the highest percentage of households using clean cooking fuel. In Armenia, female-headed and male-headed households using clean cooking fuel are 96.3 per cent and 95.7 per cent, respectively. In comparison, the lowest percentage of households in Guatemala use clean cooking fuel; more female-headed households (40.8 per cent) use clean cooking fuel than male-headed households (35.3 per cent).  4.3 Education and clean cooking fuel usage Regarding the relationship between education level and clean cooking fuel usage, this study finds that for the countries under study, as the education level increases, the percentage of households that use clean fuel as the primary source also increases (Appendix 2 provides a detailed analysis). In Indonesia, Nepal, the Philippines, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, more than 80 per cent of households with higher education use clean cooking fuel, while the percentage of households with illiterate heads using clean cooking fuel is much lower. However, this does not establish that households with illiterate heads are prone to use dirty fuel; In Tajikistan, 81.0 per cent of the households with illiterate heads use clean energy. The same for Indonesia and Nepal is 38 per cent and 53.1 per cent, respectively. Therefore, households with illiterate heads are also inclined to use clean cooking fuel. However, analysis to identify the factors responsible for this is beyond the scope of this section. In African countries, as in the case of Asian countries, the percentage of households using clean energy increases along with the increase in the household head’s education level. In Angola and Gabon, more than 90 per cent of households with higher education use clean cooking fuel, whereas in other African countries, including those where clean cooking fuel usage is shallow, the percentage is lower but still higher than that of households with illiterate heads. In European and Latin American countries, where fuel use is high, the percentage of households using clean cooking fuel increases as the education level increases. In Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Honduras, and Guatemala, more than 90 per cent of households with higher education use clean cooking fuel. At the same time, in Armenia, 87.9 per cent of households with illiterate heads use clean cooking fuel, whereas in Colombia and the Dominican Republic, more than 50 per cent of households with illiterate heads use clean cooking fuel. Therefore, also in this region, the percentage of households with higher education using clean fuel is greater than those with illiterate households.  4.4 Wealth and clean cooking fuel use In all the countries under study, wealth or economic status influences clean cooking fuel usage as it increases the affordability of the households. Appendix 3 depicts a positive relationship between the percentage of households using clean cooking fuel and the household’s wealth. In general, the use of clean fuel is low in Asian countries, and extremely low among poor households. In India, Nepal, the Philippines, and Pakistan, more than 80 per cent of wealthy households use clean cooking fuel. However, the use of clean cooking fuel by poor households is exceptionally low. In India, Afghanistan, and Nepal, less than 2 per cent of poor households use clean cooking fuel, whereas in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Timor-Leste, less than 1 per cent of poor households use clean cooking fuel. The use of clean cooking fuel in Asian countries is largely influenced by economic status. Appendix 3 shows that access to clean energy is comparatively high, even for poor households; in Indonesia, 40.7 per cent of poor households and 93.4 per cent of rich ones, in the Kyrgyz Republic, 60.4 per cent of poor households and 93.3 per cent of rich ones, and in Tajikistan, 73.7 per cent of poor households and 97.7 per cent of rich ones use clean energy. In African countries under study, clean cooking fuel use is low, and its distribution across economic status is highly skewed. In Burkina Faso, Chad, Comoros, Congo DR, Congo, Ethiopia, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and Zambia, poor households do not use clean fuel as primary cooking fuel, while the percentage of wealthy households using clean fuel ranges from 3 to 37 per cent. In Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, and Zimbabwe, less than 2 per cent of poor households use clean cooking fuel. In contrast, the percentage of wealthy households using clean energy ranges from 10 to 50 per cent. Namibia, Angola, and Gabon have slightly different statuses than other African countries. In these countries, the percentage of wealthy households using clean cooking fuel varies from 72.9 to 99.5 per cent, while for poor households, it varies from 1.9 to 41.5 per cent. In Latin American households, clean cooking fuel usage is relatively higher, and at the same time, a higher percentage of poor households use clean cooking fuel. In these countries, more than 90 per cent of wealthy households use clean cooking fuel, while the percentage of poor households using the same varies from 49.5 to 69.2. Only in Peru, only 21.4 per cent of poor households use clean cooking fuel. In Guatemala and Honduras, there is a skewed distribution of clean cooking fuel use toward wealthy households—in Guatemala, 0.5 per cent of poor households and 79.3 % of wealthy households, and in Honduras, 1.9 per cent of poor households and 85.4 per cent of rich households use clean energy. However, the situation in Haiti is similar to other African countries as only 0.1 per cent of poor households use clean energy, while 10.7 per cent of wealthy households use clean energy.  4.5 Location and clean energy use The spatial location of households influences the use of clean cooking fuel, mainly through the supply of clean cooking fuel and affordability. The countries under study show a striking difference between rural and urban households in clean cooking fuel use (Appendix 4). In Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Timor-Leste, clean cooking fuel use is relatively low, and the percentage of urban households using clean cooking fuel is significantly higher than that of rural households. In Indonesia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan, clean cooking fuel use is relatively high, and still, the percentage of urban households using clean cooking fuel is much higher than that of rural households. Therefore, the spatial location of the households is a significant determinant of clean fuel usage. Among the African countries, none of the rural households use clean fuel sources as primary cooking fuel in Chad and Congo, while in Burkina Faso, Benin, Comoros, Congo, Gambia, Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia, clean energy as primary cooking fuel use ranges from 0.3 to 4 per cent in the rural areas. However, in Angola, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, and Gabon, clean cooking fuel usage is a little higher than the other African countries and ranges from 6.3 to 31.1 per cent, while in the urban areas, it ranges from 65.9 to 85.4 per cent. Among the Latin American and Caribbean countries, Albania, Armenia, Colombia, Dominican Republic, and Peru have a greater number of households using clean cooking fuel. Nevertheless, the percentage of rural households using clean fuel is still less than that of urban households. However, in Haiti, only 1.1 per cent of rural households use clean cooking fuel, against 8.7 per cent of urban households.   5 Empirical results 5.1 Results from the probit model  Table 1  and  Fig. 2  summarise the probit model result (Appendix 5 provides a country-wise probit model). Table 1  shows the direction and magnitude of different countries with levels of significance. The gender of the household head (female head dummy) shows a positive and significant relationship at the 1 per cent level of significance in 15 countries, at 5 per cent and 10 per cent one country each. The result shows a negative and significant relationship at 1, 5, and 10 per cent in 2, 4, and 1 country/countries, respectively. This indicates that households with a female head are more likely to use clean cooking fuel than male-headed households, as females usually take the burden of collecting fuelwood and cooking. In all Latin American countries under study, the coefficient of the female head dummy (in comparison with the male head) is positive and significant at 1 %. Similarly, in most Asian countries, it is positive and highly significant, except in the case of Bangladesh, where the coefficient is negative and significant at 5 per cent level. The female head dummy coefficient is insignificant in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Timor-Leste. The female head dummy is mostly negative and significant or insignificant in Africa, except for Angola, Burkina Faso, Benin, Kenya, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe, where the female head dummy was significant and positive. The estimated coefficient is negative and significant in most Asian and Latin American countries for the variable “age of the household head,” whereas it is positive and significant in Haiti. However, in the case of African countries, the result is mixed. The negative and significant coefficient indicates that the probability of using clean cooking fuel decreases as the age of the household head increases. A possible reason for this negative impact is that households have inertia regarding the use of new energy sources. The coefficient of “household size” is significant but negative for 42 countries, indicating that increasing household size decreases the probability of using clean cooking fuel. It is positive and significant at 1 % in Angola and Armenia and insignificant in Congo, Gabon, and Ethiopia. Therefore, in general, household size negatively impacts clean cooking fuel consumption. One possible reason for this decreasing probability is that bigger households require more energy and look for traditional energy sources (such as firewood, biomass, and dung), which do not add to the fuel cost. Again, bigger households can engage more people in collecting firewood, reducing the dependency on clean cooking fuel (such as LPG), which is comparatively expensive. This study divides the households into three categories based on their economic status (poor, rich, and richest) to evaluate the impact of economic status on clean cooking fuel use. In comparison with poor households, the coefficient of the rich households is significant and positive in 35 countries (at a 10 per cent significance level) in the Asian and Latin American regions. However, in the case of Haiti, the coefficient is insignificant. The coefficient of the richest household is positive and significant in 45 countries, but insignificant in Zambia and Colombia. Therefore, as the economic status of the household increases, the probability of clean cooking fuel usage increases. Economic status or wealth indicates a household’s ability to afford relatively expensive clean cooking fuel; hence, wealthy families are more likely to use clean cooking fuel. This study again divides households, based on household-head education, into four categories: illiterate (base category), primary, secondary, and higher education. The coefficient of household-head with primary education is positive and significant in 26 countries, with secondary education positive and significant in 41 countries; and with higher education, it is positive and significant in 45 countries. However, the coefficients are insignificant in Tajikistan and Liberia. The findings from the study suggest that education strongly impacts the household’s clean cooking fuel use. This impact has several channels. First, education creates awareness about clean fuel usage and its impact on health; Second, through income; and Third, through accessibility. The probit model also shows the impact of spatial location on clean cooking fuel use in Appendix 5. The coefficient of households in rural area is negative and significant in 41 countries, while it is not significant in 7 countries. The negative and significant coefficient indicates that households in urban areas increase the probability of using clean cooking fuel. This is because developing countries’ households in rural areas have lower affordability and access to clean fuel. From Fig. 2  and Table 1 , and in line with other studies, we can conclude that female-headed households, economically affluent households, households with better-educated heads, and urban households have a greater probability of using clean cooking fuel.  5.2 Results from the decision tree The study incorporates decision tree analysis separately for each country in Appendix 6, and  Fig. 3  below depicts a summary result through a heat map. The dummy variable for the most affluent economic status (richest) is of utmost importance, followed by the rural residence of the household, household size, higher education, poor household, age of the household head, rich household, and primary level of education. The gender of the household head does not seem to be important in determining the use of clean cooking fuel. This decision tree analysis supports the findings from the probit regression as well as other previous studies.   6 Conclusion and policy recommendations The use of solid fuels, including biomass, coal, dung cake, and kerosene oil, poses significant environmental and health risks due to the emission of harmful particles and gases. Recognizing the critical importance of human health, environmental sustainability, and a sustainable future, the United Nations has included access to clean and affordable fuel sources as a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG7). However, the prevalence of solid fuel usage in developing countries, primarily due to rural households’ lack of access and capacity, presents a formidable challenge to the global effort to achieve universal access to clean and affordable fuel by 2030. This study, which utilises household-level data from 46 developing countries across four continents, investigates the factors influencing the use of clean energy as a primary cooking fuel. The findings reveal low usage of clean cooking fuel in South and Southeast Asian countries, with considerable variation, and very low usage in African countries. In contrast, barring a few exceptions, Latin American and Caribbean countries exhibit high usage of clean cooking fuel. These findings underscore the enormity of the task at hand: achieving universal access to clean and affordable fuel by 2030 appears daunting. The empirical analysis of this study further reveals that female-headed households in most countries are more likely to use clean cooking fuel than male-headed households. This trend may be attributed to the direct impact of solid fuel usage on female members, who are often responsible for fuel collection and cooking, prompting them to invest in clean cooking fuel. However, the influence of the household head varies across countries, with some showing a positive impact and others a negative one. The study also finds that households with a higher economic status and those headed by more educated individuals are more likely to use clean cooking fuel. Lastly, due to spatial location disadvantages, rural households are more likely to use solid fuel due to lack of access and affordability than their urban counterparts.  Limitations of the study The study has several limitations that merit elaboration. First, while using data spanning a decade from various countries, conducting a country-wise comparison becomes unfeasible. Therefore, this study does not aim to compare clean cooking fuel usage across countries, although it provides an insight on the severity of the problem. Second, as the study employs cross-sectional data, it precludes the drawing of causal inferences. Third, while the research encompasses data from diverse nations, it lacks exploration into the spatial disparities in clean cooking fuel usage. Fourth, as we use only primary cooking fuel due to lack of information on secondary and tertiary cooking fuel, this study fails to capture the fuel staking issues and ignores those households who may be using clean cooking fuel as secondary and tertiary sources. Finally, the study fails to delve into the environmental factors linked with cooking fuel utilization. Despite these limitations, the findings of this study can aid multilateral institutions and policymakers in developing countries in devising strategies to facilitate the transition of households to clean cooking fuel. The use of clean cooking fuel can contribute to improved environmental and human health and enhance family well-being. Therefore, policy measures to promote the transition to clean cooking energy should focus on improving access to clean energy and enhancing affordability. This can be achieved through strategies such as providing subsidies, developing infrastructure, and conducting awareness campaigns. In addition, improving household income and implementing appropriate and differentiated pricing can also play a crucial role in promoting the use of clean cooking fuel.
