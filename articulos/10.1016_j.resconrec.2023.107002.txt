                  As for the interconnections among 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), reconciling decarbonization (SDG 13) with the needs of economic growth and productive employment (SDG 8) is vital. However, balancing trade-offs between SDG 13 and SDG 8 is complicated by the difficulty of assessing how the interconnections between these two SDGs vary across cities. Here we identified the patterns among CO2 emissions, economic growth and employment structure across 297 Chinese cities through machine learning. We show that, industrial transitions towards the tertiary sector are not always the optimal option for decoupling economic growth from CO2 emissions. In contrast, manufacture and construction industries with sustainable technical enhancement can not only promote decoupling but also stabilize social employment. Our study thus has provided novel insights into the city-level interactions between SDG 13 and SDG 8, enhancing the realism of guiding regions to act as a whole for nationwide sustainability improvement.

As for the interconnections among 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), reconciling decarbonization (SDG 13) with the needs of economic growth and productive employment (SDG 8) is vital. However, balancing trade-offs between SDG 13 and SDG 8 is complicated by the difficulty of assessing how the interconnections between these two SDGs vary across cities. Here we identified the patterns among CO2  emissions, economic growth and employment structure across 297 Chinese cities through machine learning. We show that, industrial transitions towards the tertiary sector are not always the optimal option for decoupling economic growth from CO2  emissions. In contrast, manufacture and construction industries with sustainable technical enhancement can not only promote decoupling but also stabilize social employment. Our study thus has provided novel insights into the city-level interactions between SDG 13 and SDG 8, enhancing the realism of guiding regions to act as a whole for nationwide sustainability improvement.

As the impacts of climate change become increasingly visible worldwide, urgent climate actions towards a zero-carbon world are essential. However, ambitious climate actions can have both synergies and trade-offs with other objectives, such as public health, food system and energy access (Martinich and Crimmins 2019 ). Therefore, special attention is given to the SDG interconnections with respect to SDG 13 (Climate action) (Liu et al., 2018 ; Soergel et al., 2021 ). Among these interconnections, balancing the trade-offs between SDG 13 (Climate action) and SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) is particularly vital for those developing countries facing the dual challenges of pursuing economic growth and mitigating climate change. China, the largest developing country in the world and responsible for roughly a quarter of global annual CO2  emissions (Liu et al., 2022 ), is seeking solutions to reconciling climate change mitigation with the needs of economic development and social employment within a moderate framework (Li et al., 2019 ). As China's economic development has been closely associates with CO2  emissions thus far (Guan et al., 2018 ), decoupling economic growth from CO2  emissions (the decoupling) is a prerequisite for balancing the trade-offs between SDG 13 and SDG 8. To date, there is a mountain of scientific literature regarding the decoupling in China and other developing countries, with industrial transitions to the tertiary sector being widely confirmed as the primary driving force to lower the CO2  emission intensity (emissions per unit GDP) (Zhao et al., 2017 ; Shuai et al., 2019 ; Shan et al., 2021 ). Nonetheless, these "decoupling only" investigations do not provide comprehensive descriptions of the interconnections between SDG 13 and SDG 8, as the response of social employment (the other half of SDG 8) to the decoupling is always neglected. In addition, the interconnections among the SDGs have been typically quantified at national or provincial scale, making corresponding policies incompatible to individual cities (Nerini et al., 2018 ; Soergel et al., 2021 ). Cities are the primary battlegrounds for combating climate change and developing coherent policies that guide regions to act as a whole for nationwide sustainability improvement has to be based on the endowment of individual city (Bank 2022 ). Therefore, it is necessary to differentiate the interaction patterns between SDG 13 and SDG 8 across China's hundreds of cities with the significant heterogeneity regarding economic development, population, and industrial structure. To bridge these two research gaps, we compiled an extensive dataset comprising CO2  emissions from 337 Chinese prefecture-level cities between 1999 and 2018, employee proportions in 18 industrial sectors in 2018, and the gross domestic product (GDP) of 297 cities from 1999 to 2018. We employed four machine learning algorithms of cluster analysis, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and logistic regression to identify patterns in the dataset, allowing us to capture the bidirectional impacts between decoupling and employment features, and in turn revealing the full interconnections between SDG 13 and SDG 8 at the city scale. Our study provides novel insights into the city-level interactions among the SDGs, taking into account significant heterogeneity in terms of both geography (337 cities) and industries (18 subindustries), and enhancing the realism of promoting SDG synergies at the city level.  2 Material and methods 2.1 Data processing We integrated a dataset comprising 26 variables. Four of those are categorical, including city (337 cities), year (1999–2018), province (31 provinces) and city-tier (six tiers); The remaining 22 variables are numeric, including area (km2 ), GDP (CNY), population, CO2  emissions (ton), employees in 18 subindustries and the registered unemployed workers. The main determination criteria of city-tier are population and economic output according to the report of Circular of the State Council on Adjusting the Criteria for Classification of the Scale of Cities  released by the State Council of China (2014) . Data of GDP, city area, population and employee in 18 industries were manually collected from the statistical yearbooks of city. The investigated industries are shown in Table 1  . GDP and population during 1999 to 2018 are available in 297 cities while employment information in 2018 is available in 253 cities. Regarding the inaccessibility of employment data in some cities, we filled these missing values with the mean level of employees in cities at the same tier. CO2  emissions originating from all fossil CO2  sources from 1999 to 2018 on city scale were derived from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) (Crippa et al., 2020 ). Specifically, we first downloaded annual emission grid maps from 1999 to 2018 in the unit of ton substance/ 0.1°2 / year and extracted grids covering the China mainland through geographic coordinates. Next, we labeled each grid with the geographic information of country, province and city via the reverse geocode technology in Google Map. Finally, annual CO2  emissions in 337 cities were calculated by combining gridded emissions with the same city label. Details on the dataset are shown in Figure S1–S18.  2.2 Decoupling determination The determination of the decoupling is based on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). The EKC hypothesis is that, environmental pollution index first increases and then decreases with economic development, varying with an inverted U-shape curve (Yin et al., 2015 ; Destek et al., 2018 ). Such inverted U-shape relationship might be limited by various interventions as EKC is an empirical hypothesis. Here, given that our data are extensive and highly available, we fitted the EKCs for all 297 cities from 1999 to 2018 to examine the decoupling of individual cities. The EKC used here is the Gaussian Kuznets curve (Eq. (1) ):(1) P C =  a × e − ( P G D P − b  c  )   2        where PC  and PGDP  represent per capita CO2  emissions and per capita GDP at a given year, respectively. The Gaussian Kuznets curve is bell-shape and has three scale coefficient parameters of a, b  and c. a  represents the peak of the function; b  represents the projection of the curve's turning point on the PGDP-axis; c  controls the opening degree of the bell. After the EKC functions were fitted, the decoupling cities were determined by whether the per capita CO2  emissions in 2018 are below the lower of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the EKC's peak value (parameter a ), that is, whether the per capita CO2  emissions in decoupling cities have statistically significant differences from the peak values. In contrast, cities that cannot satisfy this criterion were regarded as the coupling cities. Details on the decoupling determination can be found in Figure S19.  2.3 Machine learning As the object of investigation is a high-dimensional dataset consisting of 26 variables across 337 cities, it is challenging to assess the dataset patterns through traditional statistical approaches. To tackle this problem, machine learning was employed to identify the relationships between employment structure and GDP-emission decoupling in this dataset. Here, we used four machine learning algorithms, including one unsupervised learning (cluster analysis) aims to assess the similarities between cities based on employment structure, and three supervised learning (RF, XGB and logistic regression) aim to determine the response of the GDP-emission decoupling to the independent variables of employee proportions in 18 subindustries.Cluster Analysis : We conducted hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) to aggregate cities via their similarities in terms of employment structure. The unsupervised learning of HCA aims to establish a hierarchical cluster tree according to the distance matrix of sample's feature. Here, the Euclidean distance (Eq. (2) ) is applied to measure the similarity distance between cities:(2) d i s t z → f   = ∑ i = 1  i = 18   ( x i z   − x i f    )   2              where z  and f  are sample labels, i  means the vector, i.e., employee proportions in 18 subindustries. The distance between clusters is calculated via the Average Linkage, which is more robust with less disturbing by outliers. Next, three classifiers based on RF, XGB and Logistic regression were constructed, whereby the response variable is the dichotomous label of the decoupling or coupling and the independent variables are the employee proportions in 18 subindustries. According to the cross validations and interpretations among these three models, interconnections among climate action, economic growth and employment patterns were established and thus the city-level interactions between SDG 13 and SDG 8 can be evaluated.Random forest : RF is a kind of ensemble models by coupling numerous decision trees.(Zeyuan Liu 2021 ) RF is based on bagging algorithm, i.e., bootstrap aggregation, which can reduce model variance and avoid overfitting. Bagging consists of two steps: 1. Selecting n  samples from original dataset contains N  samples with replacement to form m  new datasets (n  << N) ; 2. Fitting m  models based on the m  new datasets. The ultimate model outputs are averaged and voted by the m  models under cases of regression and classification, respectively. Trees number was set as 500.  Extreme gradient boosting : XGB is a kind of tree models assembled by k  base learners.(De Clercq, Smith et al. 2018 ) Unlike bagging, gradient boosting algorithm combines a series of weak learners into a stronger one. Boosting focuses on adding weight to weak learning accordingly to increase model accuracy, resulting in a low error but a high risk of overfitting. The algorithm of boosting is shown in Eq. (3) :(3) y ^  i ( t )   = ∑ k = 1  t  f k  ( x i  )  = y ^  i ( t − 1  )   + f t  ( x i  )            where y ^  i ( t )     is the prediction of sample i  after t  iterations; y ^  i ( t − 1  )     is the prediction from the former t -1 trees; f t  ( x i  )     is the function of tree t . Here, learning rate and maximum depth of tree were set as 0.4 and 25, respectively.Logistic regression : The logistic regression is a kind of generalized linear models, which is applied to situations where the response variable is dichotomous (decoupling or coupling) as shown in Eq. (4) :(4) log ( μ y  1 − μ y    )  = β o  + ∑ j = 1  n  β j  × X j            where μ y    is the conditional mean of y , that is, the probability that y  = 1 given a set of x  values, μ y  1 − μ y      is the odd that y  = 1, and log ( μ y  1 − μ y    )    is the log odds and the link function. The probability distribution is binomial. In this case, y  = 1 and y  = 0 represent the coupling and decoupling, respectively. In addition, feature importance of RF and XGB models can be determined through the Gini index or Information Gain. However, these conventional indicators cannot reflect the detailed effect of a given variable on model's output. In order to enhance the interpretability of machine learning models, we applied the Shapely Additive Explanation Approach (SHAP) to access the decision mechanism of tree models, allowing us to identify variation patterns between the decoupling potential and employment proportions of specific industrial sectors across different cities. Briefly, the SHAP approach is based on coalitional game theory of estimating how to distribute the total gain to several members according to individual contributions. The SHAP value is calculated as Eq. (5) :(5) g ( z ′  )  = Ø o  + ∑ j = 1  M  Ø j  z j   ′      where g  is the explainer function; M  is the feature number and z  is equal to 1 for tree models; Ø o    is a constant and Ø   is the shapely value. Here, we adopted TreeSHAP values (an rectified SHAP value aims to tree models) to save computing resources.(Lundberg and Lee 2017 ) The TreeSHAP approach is operated with the shap  module in the Python version 3.7. Machine learning and statistical analyses are conducted with R version 4.0.3.(Team 2020 ) The Gaussian Kuznets curve is fitted via the nls  function; The RF model is compiled via the package of randomForest ; The XGB model is compiled via the packages of xgboost  and matrix ; The logistic regression is fitted via the function of glm .   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Relationships between economic growth and CO2  emissions during 1999–2018 The per capita GDP of all six city-tiers exhibits remarkable increasing trends during 1999–2018 (Fig. 1  a). By 2018, the average of per capita GDP in first-, new-first-, second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-tier cities are 175.6, 143.9, 113.3, 57.2, 50.6 and 43.8 thousand CNY∙yr−1 , respectively. Before 2013, per capita GDP went hand-in-hand with per capita CO2  emissions (Fig. 1 b), corresponding to China's extensive development mode. Given cumulative pollutant emissions and severe haze pollution, the Chinese government launched the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (here after the Action Plan) in 2013, resulting in notable declines of air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2 ) and primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) (Feng et al., 2019 ). Since both CO2  and air pollutant emissions in China are largely attributed to fossil fuel combustion (Liu et al., 2022 ). the Action Plan targeting air quality improvement also promotes a partial energy transition associated with CO2  abatement (Shi et al., 2022 ). For example, the national coal consumption amounts were decreased by 30 million tons through the unqualified boiler phaseout during the Action Plan (Feng et al., 2019 ). Therefore, China's per capita CO2  emissions entered a platform period after 2013 and the average per capita CO2  emissions in first-, new-first-, second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-tier cities reach 9.6, 10.2, 10.2, 8.0, 9.1 and 9.6 tCO2 ∙yr−1 , respectively, in 2018. Fig. 1 c shows CO2  emission variations across 337 cities during the Action Plan. There is a net increase of 0.12 GtCO2  during 2013–2018, with the ratios of carbon decrease to carbon increase in power, industry and transport sectors being 0.50, 0.53 and 0.10, respectively, suggesting that the primary drivers of CO2  abatement are control measures targeting the industry and power sectors, while the transport sector still faces significant challenges in reaching its carbon peak. In regard to city-tier, economically advanced first-tier cities, such as Guangzhou (39,082.2 tCO2 ) and Shenzhen (33,949.3 tCO2 ), contribute the most to CO2  emission increments. In contrast, less developed fourth- and fifth-tier cities, such as Tongling (−43,248.0 tCO2 ) and Huainan (−20,858.4 tCO2 ), shoulder the responsibility of CO2  abatement associated with GDP declines in the Primary and Secondary industries, indicating regional inequality regarding the responsibility to CO2  abatement. Fig. 1 d shows the variations of per area GDP in cities with negative and positive CO2  emissions. Apparently, the increments of per area GDP in cities with positive CO2  emissions are usually higher than that with negative CO2  emissions. For instance, the average of the per area GDP increments in second-tier cities with positive CO2  emissions is 967.2 million CNY while it is 930.3 million CNY for those with negative CO2  emissions, suggesting that CO2  abatement typically comes at economic loss at the current stage and thus, substantial progress towards the city-level synergy attainment between SDG 13 and SDG 8 is urgently required.  3.2 Decoupling test in 297 cities Fig. 2   shows the decoupling test for the 297 cities. The fitted Gaussian Kuznets curves of the 297 cities are shown in Figure S20–25 and corresponding coefficient parameters are available in Table S1–6. Overall, there are 146 coupling cites and 151 decoupling cities in 2018 in China, exhibiting notable geographic agglomerations in which the coupling cities are significantly concentrated in the northern provinces of Heilongjiang, Hebei, Jilin, Tibet, Gansu and Inner Mongolia. The main characteristics of most coupling cities are: (1) slow economic growth compared to southern cities and (2) extensive development mode with a heavy industrial structure, resulting in a high CO2  emission intensity. In terms of city-tier, the first- and new-first-tier cities have attained overall decoupling, with the decoupling cities accounting for 75% and 80% of the totality, respectively. According to the fitted EKCs, the peaks of per capita CO2  emissions in the first and new-first tier cities are 11.6 [95% CI: 11.4–11.8] t and 9.3 [9.0–9.6] t, respectively. In contrast, the per capita CO2  emissions in the second, third, fourth and fifth tier cities remain within the 95% CIs of the peak levels and do not show significant deviations from economic growth. The tree plot illustrates the city groupings based on employment structure similarity, as determined by HCA. Cities in the tree plot are labeled with decoupling and tier information, connecting the three elements of climate action, economic growth, and employment, and thus providing an initial insight into the city-level interconnections between SDG 13 and SDG 8. Clearly, there are several significant city clusters in terms of decoupling and city tier, indicating that some similarities do exist among cities from the perspective of the composite of climate action, economic growth, and employment structure. Generally, economically advanced cities attract tertiary enterprises, such as entertainment and finance, and therefore have a high potential for decoupling, as reflected by the aggregations of first and new-first-tier cities. In contrast, most energy-intensive industries in developed cities are outsourced or transferred to less developed regions due to policy benefits, such as lower environmental taxes (Hao et al., 2018 ), and in turn restricting the decoupling in economically unadvanced cities, as reflected by the aggregations of fourth- and fifth-tier cities. As such, it is feasible to differentiate climatic policies in accordance of city clusters to improve policy coherence for overall sustainability achievement.  3.3 Unemployment risk in response to the decoupling Fig. 3   shows the employee proportions of the Primary, Secondary and Tertiary industries in decoupling and coupling cities. The median employee proportions of the Primary industry (agriculture) in coupling cities and decoupling cities are 0.72% and 0.26%, respectively, with a statistically significant difference in the Wilcoxon -test. Compared to the Secondary and Tertiary industries, the contribution of the Primary industry to China's economic increment is the smallest, with the GDP of the Primary industry accounting for 11.0% of the totality in 2018. The limited contribution of the Primary industry to economic development is not an exception at city scale. For example, even though the cities of Yichun and Shuangyashan have the highest employee proportions in the Primary industry (55.8% and 50.3%, respectively), the lion's share of GDP in these two cities is still contributed by the Tertiary industry, at 40.51% and 41.12%, respectively. Furthermore, the employee proportions of Primary industry in all first- and new-first-tier cities are less than 5%. As the decoupling is that GDP grows faster than emissions, the Primary industry-dominated cities face challenges in achieving the decoupling due to their slow economic development. As for the Secondary and Tertiary industries, there are statistically significant differences between the mean levels of employee proportions in decoupling and coupling cities for the Secondary industry, while differences for the Tertiary industry are not statistically significant. As such, cities with a substantial Secondary industry presence have a higher decoupling potential, indicating that transitioning to the Tertiary industry is not a mandatory path to achieving decoupling. Given China's rapid development in the Tertiary industry (Fig. S26), the GDP of the Tertiary industry (4.6 trillion CNY yr−1 ) surpassed that of the Secondary industry (3.8 trillion CNY yr−1 ) in 2018. However, the per capita GDP of the Secondary industry is 65.7 thousand CNY yr−1 , while that of the Tertiary industry is 60.0 thousand CNY yr−1 , highlighting the higher economic efficiency of the Secondary industry. CO2  emissions and economic growth tend to go hand in hand in the Secondary industry, as many subindustries, such as steel-making and cement-making, are energy-intensive, posing a significant challenge to deep decarbonization. However, cities dominated by the Secondary industry also have notable advantages on decoupling. Cities with a strong foundation in the Secondary industry, such as Nantong and Dongguan (with employee proportions of 83.3% and 80.0% in the Secondary industry, respectively), can mitigate CO2  emission increases through technical enhancements in energy use efficiency and electrification to achieve decoupling. This occurs because sustainable technical improvements enable continued economic growth under the current industrial structure and offer a faster response in slowing CO2  emissions compared to industrial transitions. In addition, such technical enhancements in China's Secondary industry have been largely promoted since the Action Plan. Control measures, such as coal boiler regulations and the phaseout of outdated production capacity were widely facilitated, leading to the simultaneous reductions of CO2  and air pollutants and in turn accelerating the decoupling in the Secondary industry-dominated cities (Tang et al., 2019 ; Zeyuan Liu 2021 ; Shi et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, the risk of social unemployment in decoupling cities is significantly lower than that in coupling cities. Decoupling cities typically have more enterprises in the Secondary industry, which offer more stable jobs and incomes compared to those in the Tertiary industry (Zhang et al., 2016 ). Consequently, it appears that, a city with a large-scale Secondary industry has a high potential of balancing the trade-offs between SDG 13 and SDG 8 since low-carbon technical enhancement can effectively reconcile climate action with the needs of economic growth and stable employment in a short time without a significant industrial transition. To validate this hypothesis, we identified the response patterns of the decoupling to different subindustries using supervised machine learning approaches.  3.4 Evaluation of full interconnections bewteen SDG 13 and SDG 8 via machine learning We first established a logistic model by adding variables following the forward-step strategy. That is, a blank model is filled to a full model by adding variables step by step as shown in Fig. 4  . The lower deviance the model has, the better the model is. The blank model (None) has no ability to prediction, corresponding to the highest residual deviance of 350.1. In contrast, the full variable model (after the S18 variable added) has the lowest residual deviance of 263.3. Model's residual deviance is statistically significantly decreased through adding a variable marked with asterisk (*), which an important contributor to model's output. Accordingly, the employee proportions of six subindustries have significant connections with the decoupling, which are the Secondary industries of power (S2), manufacturing (S4), construction (S3) and mining (S1), and the Tertiary industries of entertainment (S15) and public facility management (S11). According to the fitted logistic curves in boxplots, a city with higher employee proportions of S4 and S3 has a high decoupling potential while that with higher employee proportions of S1, S2, S11 and S15 has a weak decoupling potential. In regard to the tree models of XGB and RF, the overall prediction accuracies are determined as 78% and 72% through the 10-fold cross validation, respectively, as shown in the testing confusion matrices (Fig. 5  a and b). Feature importance on model's output is quantified through the SHAP value. For example, S2 and S5 are the most influential factors of the outputs of XGB and RF, respectively, corresponding to their highest SHAP values. Variables with the highest SHAP values in top four were selected as the significantly impactive factors. In addition, the impacts of the four selected variables on model's outputs across cities are shown in the scatterplots where minus and positive SHAP values represent positive and negative impacts on the decoupling, respectively. For example, the SHAP values of construction (S3) exhibit an overall decreasing trend with the increasing of employee proportions of S3, indicating a positive interaction between the developed construction industry and the decoupling. Based on the common outputs from these three models, subindustries that have the most significant interconnections with the decoupling are determined as S2 and S3 (shared by all three models), followed by S5 and S11 (shared by two models). The decoupling potential of cities decreases with the increase of the power (S2) employee proportion. At present, power generation in China relies heavily on fossil fuel and the share of renewable energy is only 15.9% in 2020 (Zhuo et al., 2022 ). Cities with high proportions of S2 employees, such as Urumqi and Fushun, are typically rich in fossil fuel resources and have vast electricity-generation capacities (Kang-Kang et al., 2009 ; Wang et al., 2017 ). In the context of climate change mitigation, conventional resource-intensive cities are facing great challenges regarding industrial transition, since the primary economic driver of power-intensive cities is often the hard-to-abate industry of coal-fired electricity generation. In addition, the potential for technical enhancements, such as fuel quality improvement targeting coal-fired or gas-fired power plants, will eventually be exhausted and thus, in-depth decarbonization associated with the decoupling requires large-scale industrial transitions. Consequently, the decoupling will have a significant impact on employment in the S2 sector, potentially increasing the unemployment rate in fossil resource-intensive cities. The relationship between the decoupling and the employee proportion of transportation (S5) exhibits notable nonlinearity. The increasing of the employee proportion of S5 is first detrimental to the decoupling and then becomes insignificant for the model outputs. China's transport heavily relies on road transportation, with diesel truck playing an important role. Despite comprising a small share of the overall truck population, CO2 emissions from diesel trucks account for the largest share (39% in 2019) of total CO2 emissions in China's transportation industry due to their high emission factor (Xu et al., 2021 ). Therefore, a city with a higher proportion of S5 employee typically accompanies larger CO2  emissions from on-road transportation, leading to the initial negative relationship between S5 employee proportion and the decoupling potential. When the employee proportion of S5 is higher than 0.6%, the negative impact of the transportation scale on the decoupling attainment is weakened, as the SHAP value is decreased but remains positive. Since the transportation advancement is closely related to the local production dimensions (Zhang et al., 2020 ), cities with the large proportions of S5 employee reflect the presence of developed local pillar industries (For instance, Urumqi and Fushun have the highest S5 employee proportions of 5.6% and 3.6%, respectively, corresponding to rich fossil resources and relevant processing industries), which are strong contributors to local GDP growing and thus partially offset the negative impact due to CO2  emissions originating from transportation on the decoupling. Unlike transportation, the employee proportion in construction (S3) shows a significant positive linear relationship with the decoupling potential, that is, cities with higher S3 employee proportions have stronger ability to attain the decoupling. China's thriving construction industry employs a massive labor force and contributes to the rapid urbanization in the new-first- and second-tier cities (Zhang et al., 2016 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ). In 2018, the number of employees in S3 is a total of 27.3 million people, second only to that of manufacturing (43.0 million people) (Fig.S28). Combining with the results of the logistic regression, cities with large employee proportions of S3 and S4 have high potentials for the decoupling attainment, which further explains the phenomenon of why the average unemployment rate in decoupling cities is lower than that in coupling cities (Fig. 3 ). At the same time, the construction industry is one of the most important economic driver in China, contributing a total of 26.4 trillion CNY product in 2020 and accounting for 26.0% of the totality (Cai et al., 2021 ). In addition, CO2  emissions from S3 have been sizably abated during the 12th Five-Year Plan (2010–2015) where the Chinese government began rectifying the nationwide building market to promote environmental-friendly construction materials, softening CO2  emission increments originating from building activities (Zhang et al., 2021 ). Together, with the involvement of low-carbon technical enhancements, construction can be a great driving force to the decoupling while providing considerable jobs. The subindustry of public facility management (S11) is the only Tertiary industry among these common outputs, exhibiting a negative response to the decoupling. That is, cities with higher employee proportions in S11 have lower decoupling likelihoods. In China, workers in S11 are major in municipal environment planning, such as air pollution mitigation and waste management (2017). First, the proportion of S11 employees is a mirror to local environmental pollution. For example, the resource-intensive cities of Hohhot and Fushun are suffering from severe environmental pollution in terms of air and soil (Cui 2017 ), and thus have urgent requirements on environmental restoration, corresponding to their highest S11 employee proportions of 0.85% and 0.82%, respectively. Second, there are strong associations between pollution emissions and greenhouse gasses in China. For instance, previous studies have suggested a significant bidirectional effect between climate action and air cleaning (Xing et al., 2020 ; Shi et al., 2021 ), as most of air pollutants and CO2  emissions are commonly incurred by fossil energy-intensive industries in China. Thus, a city with a large proportion of S11 employees usually has the agglomeration of the fossil energy-intensive industries. Third, current strategies to environmental pollution mitigation heavily rely on end-of-pipe measures rather than energy and industrial transitions associated with CO2  abatement (Zhang et al., 2019 ), resulting in the decrease of pollutant emissions but limited restriction on CO2  emissions (Fig.S13–18). Altogether, cities with large shares of S11 employees exhibit the low potentials of the decoupling.   4 Policy implications There is a great diversity across city endowments in China with regard to industrial component, economic driver and employment structure, implying that climatic policies should be differentiated to balance decarbonization, economic growth and job creation so as to promote the city-level synergies between SDG 13 and SDG 8, ultimately enhancing policy coherence at the nation scale. Based on our findings, policymakers should take four points into account: First, sustainable technical improvements aimed at reducing CO2  emission intensity should be prioritized for developed cities with construction and manufacturing as pillar industries. This approach can not only mitigate CO2  emission increases for achieving decoupling without significant industrial restructuring but also stabilize local employment. Second, facilitating transport electrification is vital for middle and small cities to soften the negative impact of transportation industry on the decoupling. In addition, given the ongoing policies of “road-to-railway” and “road-to-water” (Zhao et al., 2022 ), greater efforts should be directed towards the development of long-distance electric trucks to prevent the potential unemployment risk in the on-road transport industry. Third, since the major economic driver in fossil resource-intensive cities is coal-fired or gas-fired power sector, preferential policies for these cities to achieve industrial restructurings are essential. The government should pave the way for the restructuring on local conventional enterprises and provide subsidies for employees from fossil energy-related industries and associated transportation industries to pass through the industrial transition period. In addition, the government should encourage the commercial and technical advancement in carbon capture, utilization and storage in these fossil resource-intensive cities to extend the lifespan of conventional power-generation sectors and mitigate relevant unemployment risks (Xu and Dai 2021 ). Fourth, accelerating the coupling of climate action and environmental pollution mitigation at the city scale is crucial. The government should hasten cooperation between environment and energy departments to improve administrative efficiency and release the potential for simultaneous reductions of CO2  and pollutants. Through this approach, employees specializing in public facility management could participate in CO2  abatement associated with future industrial transitions. We acknowledge that there are some limitations in our compiled dataset, leading to uncertainties in follow-up analyses. First, employment information in some western fifth-tier cities is unavailable and replaced by the mean level of cities in same tier. This might result in some interventions with the significant determination in the three supervised learning. Second, it would be desirable to have indicators for energy and technical structure of major subindustries, such as manufacture and construction, as they would provide more evidence to support the interpretation of machine learning outputs. Third, the industry classification in our dataset remains relatively coarse, particularly for power and manufacturing sectors that encompass numerous subindustries, such as steel, cement and coal-fired power. Some important interconnections between the employment of these subindustries and the decoupling might be neglected, which are critical for supplementing policies to balance the trade-offs between SDG 13 and SDG 8. Therefore, a more detailed dataset addressing these limitations would be desirable in our future work.  Associated content Supporting Information .
