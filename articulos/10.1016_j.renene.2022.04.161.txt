                  Sustainable goals are achieved by utilizing private firms' investment in renewable energy sources. Globally, the demand for alternative sources of Renewable Energy (RE) and green finance (GF) has prompted an increase in research on these topics. This research applies a novel technique panel cointegration and causality model to evaluate the causes of green finance development in China between 1990 and 2020. This study adds information on the relationship between green finance and financial inclusion in the form of private firms' investments. The findings show that green finance and financial inclusion (FI) are beneficial to development globally and more granular. For every 1% growth in RE sources, there will be a 0.522% rise in trademark filings and a 0.1243% rise in private sector investment filings. The trademark and patent are promoted by 0.062% when financial inclusion is improved by 0.031%. Investment, commerce, and human progress have a calming effect on the connection discussed above. A variety of robustness tests supports our model results. This study's policy recommendations include decentralizing the energy industry to allow for more private sector participation; financial incentives for enterprises to use RE. It is clear from these findings that our study contributes significantly to the field of empirical research and also gives crucial policy recommendations.

Sustainable goals are achieved by utilizing private firms' investment in renewable energy sources. Globally, the demand for alternative sources of Renewable Energy (RE) and green finance (GF) has prompted an increase in research on these topics. This research applies a novel technique panel cointegration and causality model to evaluate the causes of green finance development in China between 1990 and 2020. This study adds information on the relationship between green finance and financial inclusion in the form of private firms' investments. The findings show that green finance and financial inclusion (FI) are beneficial to development globally and more granular. For every 1% growth in RE sources, there will be a 0.522% rise in trademark filings and a 0.1243% rise in private sector investment filings. The trademark and patent are promoted by 0.062% when financial inclusion is improved by 0.031%. Investment, commerce, and human progress have a calming effect on the connection discussed above. A variety of robustness tests supports our model results. This study's policy recommendations include decentralizing the energy industry to allow for more private sector participation; financial incentives for enterprises to use RE. It is clear from these findings that our study contributes significantly to the field of empirical research and also gives crucial policy recommendations.   Keywords Sustainability goals  Renewable energy  Panel cointegration and causality  China  Green finance  Financial inclusion    1 Introduction The use of renewable sources conserves natural resources by addressing climate change and significantly reduces the need for coal and oil for energy production. According to the Kyoto Protocol and IAEA, most industrialized countries that joined the pact encourage green energy sources [1 ]. Whether financial growth, the natural environment, and carbon emissions can effectively relieve environmental problems under the paradigm of globalization remains unanswered. Thus, this has demonstrated the financial backing of the theoretical justification by investigating the effects of foreign direct investment, geographical features, globalization, nonrenewable and eco-friendly resource utilization on the contribution to global warming in nations valuable in economic means from 1990 to 2020 [2 ,3 ]. According to the empirical results, there is a high correlation between cross-sections. The previous generation panel data technique is used since panel data is more robust and dependable [4 ]. Over the last 30 years, financial development has remained the dominant and sought-after component of external financing despite the global financial and economic crisis. Foreign direct investment plays a critical role in economic growth [5 ]. Over the last two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) coming into countries throughout the globe [6 ]. An increase in the income, output, job growth, economic growth, and progress of the receiving nations directly results from foreign direct investment. Several researchers and politicians believe that foreign direct investment may significantly impact a receiving country's development efforts [7 ]. Over the years, trade liberalization has emerged as the most important source of international capital inflows to quite developed countries. It has unquestionably become an important aspect of capital creation in these countries, as studied by Ref. [8 ]. As the population continues to increase to nine billion by 2040, it will necessitate an increase of 35% in conventional farming, which will lead to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the farming sector, where the majority of emissions come from the different industries running for various purposes [9 ]. Greenhouse gas emissions account for half of the total emissions to limit warming to less than 2° Celsius by 2050. As a result of these environmental impacts, attempts to conserve the environment and maintain a manageable level of global warming may be substantially hampered [10 ]. Low-pollution characteristics aside, sustainable energy's high usage costs need government support and technological development [11 ]. Consequently, RE consumption can't reach a specific level or serve as an alternative to fossil fuels without the assistance of legislation. As a result, authorities in the OECD's advanced countries began developing relevant laws shortly; Japan, a resource-poor island country, incorporated the sequences to encourage power companies to use a specific amount of new energy. This has made RE a major topic of discussion at international conferences during the last ten years. An overarching concern was finding a method of using fuel to lead to long-term economic growth while also being environmentally friendly [12–16 ]. As a result, resources seem to be one of the most potential substitutes, and this relationship between ecological sustainability and RE is very strong. Economic growth drives an ever-increasing need for energy, which has clear consequences for the environment [16 ]. Countries, particularly those in emerging economies, are eager to replace fossil fuels with renewables such as solar and solar thermal to reduce their environmental impact while also slowing down economic development. Customers, companies, and entrepreneurs are the main beneficiaries of economic growth because of the performance and efficiency with which cash can be mobilized and allocated. Various resources created by technical progress are used by those who benefit from direct investment, significantly influencing energy intensity. They also engage in various additional actions to promote industrialization, trade liberalization, economic expansion, and other factors that may have an indirect impact on green finance [17 ]. However, the effects on green finance, whether direct or indirect, may change depending on the stage of scientific advancement [18 ]. For example, the financial sector may not be able to provide customers with as many energy-saving products when technical innovation in the economy is at a lower level, for example. On the other hand, if technological advancement is at a high level, consumers and companies will have access to many energy-consuming items and new chances to employ large numbers of machines that help boost green finance. Additionally, technical advancements may provide consumers and organizations with resources for finished goods and machinery, minimizing energy use [19 ]. For this reason, it can be said that the influence of capital accumulation on green finance is caused by technical innovation and is led by scientific progress, whether the latter is encouraging or obstructing. Expanding the financial industry's expertise has necessitated a healthy and well-developed banking sector. However, it also has a tremendous physical influence on economic growth. Reduced investment obstacles and less work on financial resources would increase the trust of both investors and customers in company development and increase the use of substantial subscriptions. It is not inexpensive, though, to reap the benefits of the developing financial industry [18 ,20 ], and [21 ]. Electricity production can be tapped more effectively with a well-developed banking system, and environmental protection can be implemented with little expense and maximal resources [22 ]. Innumerable research has noted and explored the significant connection between a robust financial system and a deficiency in the environment. The present research is unique in many ways when the panel cointegration and causality model is used also after monitoring for economic growth, resource, and organizational factors in line with the predictions of neo-classical (partly) and empirical work, we discover a direct and positive influence of RE and GF on FI using unit root test, cross-sectional dependence test, and correlation analysis with fixed effects. These results are not affected by using different sub-samples or estimation methods. Evidence suggests that RE promotes innovation through encouraging investment, human capital, and trade openness, showing the possible routes of RE elevating technical development across various countries. Some empirical research has shown that renewable and efficient energy sources may help boost economic growth and appropriate utilization. Because FI is efficient and economical, some environmental impact may be realized. According to other studies, a lack of knowledge about the most recent advances in sustainable energy innovation can have serious consequences, particularly for rural societiesnear large-scale infrastructure project sites. Consequently, politicians are refocusing their efforts from scientific knowledge to research and innovation. Frameworks of the organizational context have emerged and taken into account various external factors that affect a company's ability to innovate. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2  describes the literature review and hypothesis development. Section 3  contains methodology and data sources. Section 4  consists of results and discussion and robustness analysis. Section 5  presents the conclusion and policy implications.  2 Literature review According to theoretical reasons, FI, RE, and GF all have a role in climate change [23 ,24 ]. Empirical research on the importance of financial resources in limiting environmental deterioration among developed nations is lacking. Consequently, the current research aims to address this gap [25–27 ]. The variables impacting FDI flows to advanced and emerging market economies have been extensively studied. During 1980–2010 [28 ], found that private investment in G-7 was most likely to occur when the bank's role in green finance was measured by economic output, operating costs, trademark, structural characteristics, real exchange rate, and sustainable development growth. In contrast, emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and gross domestic savings were minimal [29 ]. The only option to slow the rate of environmental deterioration is to switch to a more sustainable form of energy usage. According to Ref. [30 ], since RE cuts carbon footprints, countries must radically reduce their dependence on energy production and invest significantly in sustainable power. Also, they reaffirmed that the best approach to combating ecological damage and global warming is to move from non-renewable materials to renewable resources. According to Ref. [31 ], the transfer between fossil fuels and RE sources is unavoidable if economic development is to be environmentally beneficial [26 ,32 ], and [33 ,34 ]. The use of renewable power was also condemned by Ref. [34 ], who praised the requirement to create and spread RE to slow down the rate of warming. The authors of [35 ] items and Hotaling also emphasized the need to rapidly shift to energy sources that are either renewable, greener, or much less dangerous while still promoting economic development. In the meantime while, the sustainability of green finance is dependent on the faith that private sector investment has in it to attain the desired aim [36 ]. If an asset's current price reflects its historical information, then additional knowledge will prompt a swift increase in the price, bringing the asset's true worth closer to its market valuation [37 ]. Shareholders, financial advisers, and the administration are at risk of unleveraged vulnerabilities when business statements are not linked. Green finance might be eroded to support ordinary interest rates and other formal economic markets. As a result, the green finance market's potential to guide the global economy toward ecological sustainability may be weakened. Because tackling climate change is an increasing concern among stakeholders, firms have tried to improve their corporate reputation by openly adopting sustainability problems without good content to back such "green" assertions about environmental maintenance [38 ]. Entrepreneurs, policymakers, and consumers all affect sustainable development accounting policies. Investors will be influenced by the effectiveness of such financial accounting and explanations if they are of poor quality. Others allege that organizations are engaging in a practice known as "green finance" by inflating their"ideology assertions" about performance measurement via their disclosure practices [39 ]. According to Ref. [28 ], integrating financial inclusion, private investment, and non-financial information into green finance can be a comfortable way to highlight and sustain RE in a new way to counter the adverse effects generated by the ongoing scenario around the world. "The validated model to associate disclosed information with shareholder necessities and offer additional precise data," he writes. "It facilitates better choices, reduces costs, and enhances regulatory compliance." Furthermore, these "complete system structures are typically" facilitated by these unsupervised Comprehensive Accounts [40 ]. Decision-makers' verification and assessment are unavoidable if an integrated organizational report is more effective. The [41 ] Energy Strategy states that green finance and financial inclusion are critical to establishing a more efficient, safe, and low carbon economy [42 ]. The UK government's efforts to improve international competitiveness include GF [43 ]. Towards ecological sustainability [44 ], proposes that solar technology growth in G-20 nations may have a multiplier effect on economic advancement. As a result of this phenomenon, countries [44 ] concluded that increasing RE would improve the sustainability of the environment. According to Ref. [45 ], the advantages of RE production outweigh the costs for families. According to Ref. [46 ], there is no link between renewable fuel use and sustainable development in low, medium, and high-income countries. 2.1 Hypothesis 1 There is a strong link between RE, green finance, and financial inclusion. According to several different theories, financial inclusion is necessary for a country's overall economic development. The economically affected, the majority of whom are mostly impoverished and illiterate, benefit greatly from the ability to save and track their financial transactions via the use of a financial institution. It allows them to get financing and invest in new businesses. Such firms enable people to earn more money than if they worked for a low-paying job [47 ]. Lenders might enhance the effectiveness of money for financing by relaxing credit rules for this group. As a result, the nation's economic investment was reduced, contributing to higher overall growth [48 ]. Increased accessibility to interest rates and lines of credit has a positive impact on newer areas of the state. It helps lenders diversify their portfolios, decrease risk, increase lending, and contribute to the economy's overall development [49 ]. By increasing borrowing from private sector participation, Green finance makes credit risk more efficient as a significant instrument [50 ]. Financial inclusion's influence on green finance has received little empirical attention in the past [51 ], but this analysis adds to the available sparse work. The impact of RE on human resources is the last critical connection between green finance and financial inclusion. Increasing living standards, improving access to quality, and guaranteeing that all civilizations have equal and fair access to RE sources are just a few ways that energy may produce positive outcomes for growth. Financial inclusion is a major asset for the sector's growth in the era of knowledge by processing information and converting it into production. For instance, research shows that the cost of generating new products is directly proportional to the number of creative people engaged in doing so [52 ]. Private sector participation, in turn, is essential to the success of financial inclusion. On the other hand, green finance enhances total factor productivity by seeking to make external and domestic capital more desirable. A sustainable approach for all life depends on a GF that utilizes RE sources to produce goods and services. Using FI sources to create GF may help combat climate change pollutants while protecting human well-being from harmful air pollutants. For example [53 ], for instance, claims GF aids in the preservation of natural areas and resources while also enhancing human well-being and addressing human needs. RE positively influences human capital development, but fossil fuels negatively affect [54 ]. As stated by Ref. [55 ], it protects against neurodegeneration, breathing problems, malignancies, and heart problems. Using G-20 (HDI) data [56 ], found that increasing access to RE sources substantially impacts the human development report. RE sources provide greater promise than other methods of mitigating climate change [57 ]. RE benefits include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased life expectancy, and lower healthcare costs, according to Ref. [58 ]. According to the [59 ], HDI in rural areas may be improved by employing excellent energy supplies and clean fuels locally available. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the potential of RE to reduce pollution and improve human well-being. Because of this, the availability of energy is a key component of pleasure. A wide range of benefits may be gained from RE, including increased access to nutritious foods, job creation, and reduced health concerns. Increased economic efficiency and research and development as a major component of manufacturing are two of the many benefits of making the energy industry more efficient via green finance (GF). To put things into perspective, GF boosts the potential of nations to innovate through improving trade openness, overall investment, and private sector participation. From the other perspective, output variables such as skilled labor, money, and financial inclusion may impact efficiency via these three channels. GF and FI are shown to be linked in theory. Consequently, we arrive at the following second hypothesis on RE and private sector investment.  2.2 Hypothesis 2 Green finance is promoted by finance, commerce, business, and entrepreneurship in RE. It is possible to explore the link between economic development and energy use by utilizing four propositions. First, there's the idea that the amount of energy we use affects how fast the economy grows. However, previous research has mainly focused on finding the cause-and-effect relationship between GF and FI, with little or no regard for how GF and FI might affect RE. According to this theory, energy conservation has a negative impact on economic development since it reveals a one-way relationship between energy use and income. On the other hand, the environmental protection hypothesis establishes a one-way monetary policy and energy use [60 ,61 ]. Lower efficiency used to show significantly affect financial development. The input argument suggests that economic development and green finance are linked in a negative feedback loop, showing that efficiency negatively impacts financial development and energy consumption. As a result, the feedback hypothesis indicated a two-way causality between increases in production and increased energy use. Furthermore, the nondiscrimination theory does not demonstrate a causal relationship between economic growth and green finance use. It also indicates that reducing one's energy usage has no impact on economic development [62–65 ].   3 Data and model 3.1 Theoretical framework We found that the recent Covid-19 epidemic disrupted most global economic and financial operations and those in China, which was the first country to be infected and was the most severely impacted. Our findings align with previous research and the study's stated goals. It is also worth noting that China is the world's largest importer of energy and the second-largest emitter of CO2 . Therefore, it is critical to look into Chinese green finance investment and technological innovation to improve RE efficiency and sustainable development goals. The function of green finance in technological innovation has been extensively studied. Green finance and technological innovation are linked in a two-way interaction known as the " Renewable Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Development Goals."The previous studies exaggerated Green Finance as a predictor of economic development, which failed to consider its influence. Green finance is important to many other studies, and they claim that it may affect long-term growth rates by affecting saving rates, investment choices, and technological innovation. Many more studies support this claim. The financial industry can quickly identify the most promising new developments by focusing on technical initiatives with a high likelihood of success. In addition, the financial services business collects individual savings and makes it easier to make better use of those funds, which improves resource allocation and spurs technical innovation. Green finance has a favorable effect on economic development regardless of the country's bank or stock market structure. However, developing nations have a hurdle since a lack of financial development might prevent them from reaping the advantages of technological transfers that could help them flourish. It is believed that green finance would positively influence sustainable development since finance is projected to contribute to technological innovation. In light of past research, this effect is achieved via various pathways. RE may be used to achieve sustainable economic development because non-renewable energy use leads to unregulated environmental deterioration and diminishment of natural capital, argues that it is unsustainable.  3.2 Model specification Estimated time-series statistical results for green finance in China are available. Rather than concentrating on the actual application of financial inclusion, this research focuses on the initial RE framework. Furthermore, additional RE resources, such as wind speed prediction and tidal energy production estimates, may benefit by employing the proposed methodology. T indicates the time duration in the panel dataset, and N denotes the number of cross-sections (regions). The panel's configuration with T and N makes the panel cointegration and causality methodology a good fit. Data from the specific areas of China may be used to build a time-duration estimate of RE. Perceptive RE was used to produce green finance production forecasts. As long as the elements can exponentially so that the synthesis is stable, they are said to be cointegrated. The cointegration test is the matrix of regression coefficients that renders such an integration stable [66 ]. devised a test for cointegration based on regression. The factors to be cointegrated if the standard deviations were I(0) [67 ]. was enlarged to a multivariate framework by Refs. [68 ,69 ]. Tests of cointegration tests for heterogeneity curves and trends are possible in Refs. [70 ,71 ]. GF and FI are the significant variables, and the corresponding long-run connections are estimated.(1) l n ( G F )  i , t   = α i  + δ i  t + β 1 i   l n ( R E )  i , t   + β 2 i   l n ( F I )  i , t   + e i , t       (2) l n ( G F )  i , t   = θ i  + λ i  t + ρ 1 i   l n ( R E )  i , t   + ρ 2 i   l n ( F I )  i , t   + ψ i , t       Where N is the number of cross-sections and T is the number of total intervals. This component describes the predictable patterns in specific cross-sections and is the fixed effects variable e ^  i , t   = γ ^  i  e ^  i , t − 1   + u ^  i , t     . There are seven statistics produced for the estimated residuals (ψ ^  i , t   = κ ^  i  ψ ^  i , t − 1   + r ^  i , t     ). The null hypothesis H 1  : γ i  = γ < 1 ( κ i  = κ < 1 )     of no cointegration is tested as a residual-based assumption H 1  : γ i  = γ < 1 ( κ i  = κ < 1 )     for all 'for between' data. There is a common value of (H 1  : γ i  < 1 ( κ i  < 1  )    ) for the 'and within' numbers when testing the null hypothesis H 0  : γ i  = 0 ( κ i  = 0 )    . It is possible to include structural breakdowns into panel cointegration using the method [72 ,73 ], and [69 ]. Probabilistic procedures Y i t   = ( y i t   , x i t   )     may be used to include the elements that cause cross-section dependency. For each of the non-stationary random processes defined by the technique, the constituent is assigned to the m-by-1 vector. The method by which the data is generated is described by:(3) Y i t   = D i t   + x i t  ′  δ i t   + u i t        D i t      indeterminism refers to the term's generic integrand(4) D i t   = μ i  + β i  t + ∑  j = 1  m i   θ i j   D U i j t   + ∑  j = 1  m i   γ i j   D T i j t        As a set D U i j t   = 1    of where D T i j t   = ( t − T i t  b  )     and signify the time of the third break t > T i t  b    , with T i t  b  = λ i t  b  T    thereafter (0,1). The time-dependent definition of the cointegrating vector given here i = 1 , … , N , λ i t  b  T ∈ Λ , Λ   . If the forecast has a better precision x t     when we utilize the previous values as opposed to that when we aren't using one another, what other variables x t     Stay the same; the factor is used to Granger cause. A vector error-correction model (VECM) established by Engle and Granger is used to detect the correlation. We undertake Granger causality analyses on the link between fi and economic development by integrating credit as a factor. The following equations constitute the empirical model.(5) Δ E G i t   = θ 1 i   + λ 1 i   E C i , t − 1   + ∑  k = 1  m  θ 11 i k   Δ E G i , t − k   + ∑  k = 1  m  θ 12 i k   Δ F I i , t − k   + ∑  k = 1  m  θ 13 i k   Δ C R i , t − k   + u 1 i t       (6) Δ F I i t   = θ 2 i   + λ 2 i   E C i , t − 1   + ∑  k = 1  m  θ 21 i k   Δ F I i , t − k   + ∑  k = 1  m  θ 22 i k   Δ E G i , t − k   + ∑  k = 1  m  θ 23 i k   Δ C R i , t − k   + u 2 i t        The long-term calculation uses RE average annual arithmetic mean. As a whole, the administration is promoting and not contributing. As a result, the governments of China nations must take an active role. Although Africa's power generation capacity is gradually expanding, frequent blackouts, particularly in large nations like the USA, negatively impact corporate operations and the region's economic progress. High-level dedication is thus necessary. The connection has been stable for a long time if the GF factor is positive. The RE coefficient's size indicates the connection's efficiency and the rate of equilibrium stabilizing. The lag length was determined using the Schwarz Bayesian criterion. Tests for all equations used to establish long-term causation H 0  : λ 1 i   = 0   . The panel VECM equations used to depict economic development change and financial development are not included in the RE definition but should be anyway. As a result, the causation between FI and GF can be in equations [74–76 ].  3.3 Variable selection RE, a range of factors, such as the growth of renewable energy technology, consumption of fossil fuels, ecological sustainability, and energy independence, has led to worldwide investments in natural energy conversion. Because fossil fuels have been nearing extinction and their emissions have skyrocketed in the 21st century, renewables have become more important. The utilization of RE sources is expanding at an alarming rate. Climate change, structural stability, and ecological health adversely affect our reliance on nonrenewable energy sources. According to the United Nations, one of the most serious global issues is how to produce and effectively use energy that comes from clean energy sources. Green finance, a recent study by Ref. [77 ], analyses the average share values of green finance indexes to learn about the liquidity of the green bond market. The green finance idea is immediately relevant and of high interest in the energy transition context. A major challenge to green finance is how to get the necessary funds from all three sectors: government, commercial, and non-profit. The challenge is to develop a market structure that can effectively mobilize the financial market to promote green initiatives. Climate change academics and professionals seek an appropriate method to establish private incentives to gather the necessary capital to accelerate the transition to a climate-resilient economy. Existing research is to find ways to increase green investments. Data from the green financial market (green bonds and clean stock indexes) and energy commodities markets are used. To simulate the connection in the context of different investor sentiments. Financial inclusion, trade openness, and human capital index are dependent variables for this study. The trademark is a vital component of technology transfer, and it has a considerable impact on gauging development. In terms of promotion, the mark covers various wider activities, from production to providing services, than in the past. Additionally, dedicated institutions collect and maintain company name information and categorization, making it reliable for decades. Not all inventions are trademarked since service marks raise the price of things, such as innovative materials. It leads businesses to contemplate not utilizing assets. The overall result in essential features of social growth such as having a full and productive life, becoming knowledgeable, and maintaining a decent standard of living is measured by the HDI. Thus, HDI contributes to TI by studying and converting it into output. HDI thinks that the best approach to building a skilled workforce is via curriculum [78 ]. Business ratios have increased among most trading nations due to liberalization and globalization, which have led to more macroeconomic efficiency.  3.4 Data sources By altering the financial sustainability of ecologically friendly initiatives, changes in energy costs may influence the profitability of green financial instruments. Green financial instruments will investigate global stock index fund interdependence and risk spill-overs. From 1990 to 2020, this report gathers and summarizes statistics on important variables in Chinese regions throughout the nation. The information comes primarily from regional statistical yearbooks, the "China Banking Social Responsibility Report," quarterly reports from national and provincial statistical bureaus and banks, the "China Industrial Statistical Yearbook," the "China Financial Statistical Yearbook," and the "China Environmental Statistics Yearbook."   4 Results and discussion 4.1 Basic statistics As a result, greater overall RE transition to green finance capacity may stimulate renewable energy-related development. In Models (1) and (3), though, green finance considerably lowers the amount of continuous improvement, showing that as the percentage of green finance production increases, the degree of RE development decreases. The percentage contribution fell to 25.65% in 2005 and then gradually increased, while sustainable energy development peaked in 2012. It also suggests that the alternative energy entrepreneurship ecosystem is inefficient, meaning enterprises with low percentages of sustainable energy have considerably more room for research in diminishing typical conventional energy surplus and consensus on greenhouse gas reductions. Table 1   shows the descriptive statistics for all parameters. Table 1  reports that the mean trademark is 7.022 while the median value is 7.090, indicating that the statistic has a large variance. More than half of the countries' intellectual development is above the average value. Tables 2 and 3    statistically explain the regression analysis of fixed term effects of renewabe energy and green finance on financial inclusion. Furthermore, the mean and median for the trademark are 8.988 and 9.072, respectively. The average for GF is 7.951. The statistical significance is 1.944, indicating that the nations' FI performance varies greatly. Furthermore, the mean of the total variable exceeds the covariance, suggesting positive outcomes.  4.2 Regression results This research also employed the Hausman test to assess if the link between the covariate and demonstrated variables is a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model. According to our data, we cannot accept the null hypothesis (Prob. > chi2 = 0.000), which means the fixed effect regression approach is better than the coefficient of determination in this research. As a result, the FOLS forecasting model was the primary regression technique in this investigation. However, this research focuses primarily on the elements of RE regulation and source dependency in the link between green finance and financial inclusion. To demonstrate a panel threshold model, divide the country into varying data reliance and financial inclusion compliance periods, and track the association between renewable economic growth in various intervals. Financial inclusion is the first factor we'll be looking at in this research. Over time, several proxy measures have been utilized in empirical investigations to measure the impact of financial inclusion. Therefore, a financial index was constructed, taking commonly used proxy measures into account. The first step is to look at the gross domestic product ratio [79 ]. Second, the domestic credit to the private sector to GDP ratio measures the amount of foreign credit available to the private sector. We can see the impact of RE and green finance on financial inclusion when the dependent variable is present—in column (4) of the data as a dependent variable in the model (6). According to column (4), the variable of RE is 0.321 when the two control variables of international trade and investment, which is meaningful at 5%. Lines (5)–(6), which show the findings after adjusting for other factors, also support this view. There are several reasons for this result. RE operates as a driving factor for human and social capital development; it enhances projected cash flows to creative industries; it promotes economic certainty and enhances international competitiveness. Previous studies have shown a substantial long-term link between green finance usage and financial inclusion, and our finding backs up those results.  4.3 Fixed effect regression results In contrast, other theories in the energy public discussion tend to concentrate primarily on the link, either in the intermediate or long term. As a result, the TR1 method incorporates FI as its threshold variable. At a 1% concentration, an elastic coefficient of 0.1495 is predicted with RE -4.260. When 5.332 trades 1.337, the resource-dependent elastic coefficient is between 0.0936 and 0.6281; when capital investment is 3.177, a private sector investment of 0.0633 is obtained; and when the human quality index is 3.177, a value of 0.3968 is obtained. The availability of natural resources heavily influences RE development. The need for long-term regional development is fueling the fast expansion of RE sources. As the environmental resources that sustain it increase, so does the capacity to develop them and keep prices down, allowing for a steady and fast expansion. Several locations with high energy demands have long regarded themselves as "heavy loads and lacking supplies," owing to a misunderstanding of the abundant RE resources. As concluded by Ref. [80 ], resources and economic growth benefit from reassessing one's own nation's resources.  4.4 Robustness analysis We now examine if there is a threshold impact on green finance due to financial inclusion in our sample. Table 4   shows the threshold test findings in parentheses with the 95% probability value and the numerical results at 1%, 5%, and 10% statistical significance. If the calibration curve is ruled out as a possibility, at least one threshold must exist. If the scientific theory of just one threshold is false, then the research investigates the case of multiple criteria. When the study uses increased investment level (a proxy for financial inclusion) as a threshold variable, each bank performance category exhibits a local linear influence on energy intensity while the threshold value is changed. A 5% significance level for an alternate hypothesis means that the market index's minimum impact is not as significant. In Table 5  , the impact of green finance on financial inclusion is estimated using GMM to ensure that it is resilient to the effects of endogeneity and covariates. Our model treats green finance and other covariates as endogenous by considering monetary inclusion and RE changes by bidirectional causality or an omitted variable. Considering that financial inclusion only affects RE with a lag, we believe RE and other relevant attributes in our theory as a predefined, yielding system incorporating even in the context of data formats. Using year factors, researchers may examine how dependent variables (innovations) change through time in different years and nations. It is also resistant to autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity, a huge plus. Following [81 ], TO favorably influences RE innovation by the findings of their study. Developing nations (or areas) with high exchange controls have fewer options to connect with cutting-edge technical expertise via channels, which is why they are not favorable to the growth of global commerce. Inevitably, a lack of technical touch and connection with the rest of the world would lack creativity. Our findings vary in terms of legal and property and regulation because of our diverse sample nations and study periods. According to their findings, the opposite is true. Cross-sectional studies like this one may confront several difficulties in estimating the long-term impact of green finance on financial inclusion. We can't deal with every problem in this research, but our work does deal with some of the more important ones. As a result, the level of progressive openness and green finance has a considerable effect on innovative activities. Table 6   illustrates the four sub-samples of the independent research on the subjects' varying levels of development and features.   5 Conclusion and policy implications Macroeconomic studies show that RE, green finance, and financial inclusion are linked. There must be a goal to increase energy availability and consumption to achieve environmental sustainability. That's why authorities must work to make energy more readily available while also limiting its harm to people's environment and public health. In addition, a more efficient allocation of private sector investment and cleaner energy resources to maintain economic growth. We conducted empirical research to understand better how RE and green finance impact financial inclusion. According to trademark and private sector participants, RE and green finance positively impact innovation when ecological, economic, and organizational aspects are taken. The findings show that RE policies drive the development of complementary technologies. On the other hand, the policy has a varying influence on the scale of the impact on various aspects of financial inclusion. As RE usage increases by one percent, trademark and private sector participation increase by 0.1243%, 0.279%, and 0.437%, respectively. In comparison, patent applications increase by 0.275%, 0.151%, and 0.114% in countries with stricter RE legislation. Improving energy efficiency also helps trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property rights by 0.036%, 0.029%, and 0.054%, respectively. The ways in which RE may aid in the growth of green finance. As a result of RE, capital, commerce, and human capital have a greater influence on financial inclusion. The RE multiplier impact on capital has further benefits for new statistical applications for development. Statistically significant, it positively affects trademarks and private sector investment in related technological fields. It also encourages the development of new RE -complementing technologies thanks to trade openness. Expanding the number of trademarks and patents on alternative energy sources is necessary if nations implement a nationwide clean RE policy. As evidenced by improved business and human-friendly sustainability rates in countries with strong renewable policy initiatives, RE appears to offer spillover effects for fostering innovation. As a result, economic stimulation, trade openness, and human resource development are all boosted when using RE sources. We obtained comparable results using two-stage least squares, fixed-effect Poisson regression with fixed effect, and system extended moment technique. We used the sub-sample method to make sure our estimates were solid. For policies that promote financial inclusion and incorporate new renewable sources to achieve a deep transition to a low-carbon economy, our results offer a variety of policy implications. Because measures are required to green finance efficiency and sustainable development, aside from concentrating on topics that directly impact RE, authorities should also join the hunt for additional methods to ensure long-term advancements in financial inclusion and private sector investment. According to the report, RE regulations positively impact human economic growth, commerce, and capital, promoting organizational effectiveness.I. The administration should push businesses in major industrial countries to engage more RE sources for technological advancement. These incentives and financial incentives may also achieve this objective.  II. For private sector activities to reduce technical expenses, an economic incentive for new RE research should be available by purchasing costs. Even if these additional expenses to the price of electricity, the impact of handouts will be greater.  III. There should be more government support for RE while tackling environmental challenges. Because of this, these measures may help foster development and long-term economic growth.  IV. As a result of abundant and inexpensive renewable resources, new alternative energy sources will be more widely adopted, supporting more advanced energy technology growth and usage.  V. Governments must ensure that prices can compete and laws are well-enforced.  VI. Green finance and sustainable activities should be promoted by businesses and consumers alike via the implementation of climate change policy and other environmental safeguards.  VII. Presenting countries on the resource supply market with tradable and domain registrars.  VIII. Carbon taxation, closed-loop control tariffs, and renewable electricity constraints should be adopted to promote fossil fuel use. Increased demand for RE will motivate corporations to switch from fossil fuels.  IX. It is time for countries to move their energy needs away from conventional renewable resources and toward RE generation to foster innovation. As a result, different countries and regions have different aims for RE policy and development, such as energy security and economic strategies. There are several ways in which RE helps to stimulate growth, from fundamental technological advancements to better basic research and installation methods to better market procedures for industrialization and entrepreneurship. When it comes to encouraging improvement, countries must have the right policies and institutions.
