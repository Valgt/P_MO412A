It is hard to imagine that anything of importance could have been left out of the 17 goals and 169 targets included in Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development , which lays out an integrated, multifaceted “plan of action for people, planet and prosperity”.1,2   The SDGs are comprehensive, visionary, and inspiring in many ways. But in at least one respect they fall short: they take a narrow view of sexual and reproductive health and rights, one of the most crucial, but also most controversial, parts of the SDG agenda. There are two targets in the SDGs that explicitly mention sexual and reproductive health. Target 3.7, under the health goal, states: “By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes.”1   Target 5.6, part of the gender goal, aims to “Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences.”1   These targets offer a solid basis for moving forward on sexual and reproductive health and rights; they explicitly mention family planning and the integration of reproductive health into national health strategies, and they reference the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and 1995 Beijing outcome documents, which together provide a broad (but now outdated) definition of sexual and reproductive health and rights. In this respect, the SDGs do better than the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which completely omitted reproductive health when they were adopted in 2000. A reproductive health target was only included in the MDGs 7 years after their adoption in response to a sustained campaign by advocates.3   Other SDG targets will address additional aspects of sexual and reproductive health and rights, including maternal and newborn health and HIV/AIDS (targets 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3), on which progress during the past 15 years has been substantial but not enough to meet the MDG health goals.4,5   It is unlikely, however, that the monitoring framework for the SDGs—to be adopted in March, 2016, by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators6  —will include more than a few indicators for sexual and reproductive health and rights. On the basis of recommendations to date, these indicators are likely to cover family planning, adolescent fertility, and perhaps comprehensive sexuality education.7   The SDGs are not likely to encompass other important elements of sexual and reproductive health and rights, including safe abortion, non-discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and the importance of high-quality, confidential, and timely sexual and reproductive health services. The sexual and reproductive health and rights community has been down this road before. In the past 2 years, the UN marked the 20th anniversaries of ICPD and Beijing. These events were notable primarily for opposition from some member states and their conservative allies to abortion, adolescent sexual and reproductive health services, and sexual rights. As a result, the outcomes of these anniversary events reaffirmed the ICPD Programme of Action and the Beijing Platform for Action, but did not advance the agenda on sexual and reproductive health and rights in any substantial way.8–10   One women's rights group described the political declaration that emerged from the Beijing 20th anniversary process as “not what women need”.11   Clearly, UN processes alone cannot be relied on to articulate a progressive and evidence-based vision of how to move forward on sexual and reproductive health and rights. And so the Guttmacher Institute and The Lancet  are establishing a Commission on sexual and reproductive health and rights in the post-2015 world. The Commission will begin work in early 2016 with the aim of developing a wide-ranging and evidence-based agenda for key sexual and reproductive health and rights priorities worldwide over the next 15 years; just as important, it will also make the case for the adoption of policies and programmes to turn that vision into reality. Although it will encompass all elements of sexual and reproductive health and rights, the Commission will emphasise important concerns that have been overlooked or neglected in the SDGs, such as the availability of safe abortion and access to high-quality sexual and reproductive health information and services, including for adolescents, men, and sexual minorities, that respect sexual and reproductive rights and prioritise the needs of vulnerable and neglected populations. The Commission will articulate a vision, define priorities, and produce a set of recommendations for sexual and reproductive health and rights on the basis of the best available evidence. In doing so, it will build on and update The Lancet 's 2006 Series on sexual and reproductive health,12   which summarised available evidence and noted the influence of conservative forces in undermining progress on these issues. The Commission's recommendations will also take into account what the sexual and reproductive health and rights community sees as the core challenges to be addressed and the key actions that need to be taken. We anticipate that the Commission's report will generate greater understanding of the centrality of sexual and reproductive health and rights to the broader health and development agendas, and inspire deeper engagement by civil society, donors, governments, and other stakeholders. Sexuality and reproduction are, after all, universal concerns that affect every human being. Although there has been great progress in recent decades, the global community must now expedite and expand that progress to be more inclusive and comprehensive. A new agenda for sexual and reproductive health and rights is needed that recognises the full scope of people's sexual and reproductive health needs, and enables all people to choose whether, when, and with whom to engage in sexual activity; to choose whether and when to have children; and to access the means to do so in good health.13   Guttmacher Institute     I am President and CEO of the Guttmacher Institute.
