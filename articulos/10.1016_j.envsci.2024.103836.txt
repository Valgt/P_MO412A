                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) consist of a set of multidimensional indicators comprising 17 goals and 169 targets from various perspectives. The use of a composite index is crucial for assessing the overall performance of each country in relation to the SDGs, given the extensive range of indicator measures involved. However, different weight schemes may lead to different results. Therefore, incorporating an objective weight is required to ensure the comparability and accuracy of the index. The main objective of this paper is to construct an SDG index for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries using an effectiveness-based hierarchical data envelopment analysis (H-DEA) model and apply it to assess SDG effectiveness in OECD countries. The results of this study provide countries with more valuable insights based on the weights of the goals (indicators) that are endogenous to the dataset, assisting them in identifying priorities and strategies to improve future SDG performance.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) consist of a set of multidimensional indicators comprising 17 goals and 169 targets from various perspectives. The use of a composite index is crucial for assessing the overall performance of each country in relation to the SDGs, given the extensive range of indicator measures involved. However, different weight schemes may lead to different results. Therefore, incorporating an objective weight is required to ensure the comparability and accuracy of the index. The main objective of this paper is to construct an SDG index for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries using an effectiveness-based hierarchical data envelopment analysis (H-DEA) model and apply it to assess SDG effectiveness in OECD countries. The results of this study provide countries with more valuable insights based on the weights of the goals (indicators) that are endogenous to the dataset, assisting them in identifying priorities and strategies to improve future SDG performance.

As a continuation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are not limited to developing countries but apply to all countries, and the process of implementation differs from a "one-size-fits-all" approach (Sachs et al., 2019 ), emphasizing the importance of paying attention to the specific situation of each country and combining ambitious global development goals with country-specific development targets, thus making SDGs more operational. Given the marked differences in context between countries, each with unique strengths and weaknesses, assessing the performance of national SDGs to provide policy makers with a prioritization of goals for development and to more effectively accelerate the sustainable development process in each country is a very challenging topic and has received a great deal of attention (CristÃ³bal et al., 2021; Nhamo et al., 2020; Radermacher, 2015 ). Due to the multidimensional nature of sustainable development indicators and the clear advantages of the composite index (CI) in synthesizing multidimensional information into one indicator, analyzing a large number of indicator measures and assessing performance, it is considered the most widely used framework in sustainable development indicator systems (Kwatra et al., 2020 ). CI can help policy makers better understand the overall situation, assess policy effectiveness and make strategic decisions and is widely used in many areas; for example, the Human Development Index (HDI), introduced by the United Nations Development Programme to measure the level of economic and social development of member countries; the Logistics Performance Index (LPI), published by the World Bank to measure the speed and reliability of cross-border freight transport across countries; and the Global Food Safety Index (GFSI), a comprehensive review of food safety created by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). To monitor and assess countries' progress toward sustainable development and facilitate policy development, the Bertelsmann Foundation and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) have partnered to publish the SDGs Index. Despite the apparent advantages of the CI, it is sensitive to the method of assigning weights, as the calculation involves weighting different indicators (OECD, 2008 ). Different weight allocation methods may lead to different results, bringing into question the comparability and accuracy of the index (Cherchye et al., 2008; Costanza et al., 2016; Foster et al., 2013; Greco et al., 2019; Hwang and Yoon, 1981; Radermacher, 2015 ). When creating SDG CIs, scholars have developed several methods to derive weights, including the Delphi method (e.g., Diaz-Sarachaga and Ariza-Montes, 2022 ), statistical analyses such as principal component analysis (PCA) (e.g., Jeganathan et al., 2021 ), the entropy weight method (e.g., Ding et al., 2024 ), and multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), such as the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) (e.g., Gireesh and Chandan, 2022 ), the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (e.g., AydÄ±n et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2022 ), and TOPSIS (e.g., Zong et al., 2023 ). Some scholars have also used the objective relative efficiency score of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method, a nonparametric efficiency assessment method, as the weights of the indicators in the CI and weighted and aggregated them together with other indicators to form a more comprehensive CI (Chang et al., 2013 ). The selection of an appropriate weighting methodology should be based on context-specific and decision-making objectives so that it can reflect political, social, and economic prioritiesÂ (Munda, 2004 ). SDGs involve multiple objectives and indicators covering a wide range of economic, social, and environmental domains, and SDGs are a dynamic framework that needs to be continually adapted to changing conditions and priorities. Therefore, objective and comprehensive weights that can adapt to changes in uncertainty are significant for aggregating various attributes from SDG subindicators to create a CI, which is the focus of this paper. Sachs et al. (2016)  began publishing an annual Sustainable Development Report in 2016, which includes the SDG Index and Dashboards, designed to assess individual countries' performance on the 17 SDGs and provide information on the country's ranking, score and progress on each goal. However, in aggregating the SDG index, all indicators in the report are given the same weight (Sachs et al., 2016 ), which may not accurately reflect the importance and priority of the different goals and ignore country-specific circumstances (Greco et al., 2019; Nhamo et al., 2020; Parris and Kates, 2003 ). It is therefore crucial to weigh these shortcomings and consider appropriate adjustments and weight assignments when calculating and interpreting the SDG Index. Resce and Schiltz (2021)  considered the hierarchical nature of SDGs and proposed assessing the SDG performance of European countries using hierarchical stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (HSMAA) with weights generated through a Monte Carlo stochastic simulation of values, and their study revealed that the ranking of countries varied significantly depending on the set of weights. Carrillo (2022)  suggested a new composite index approach to assess the SDG performance of 27 EU countries, also arguing that the importance of each indicator is different and that using a weighted average approach to assign equal weights does not reflect the heterogeneity of countries, whereas a geometric mean was used to calculate the weights. There are also other scholars who assess the SDG without using equal weights, such as Ruiz-Morales et al. (2021)  for ordered weighted average operators, Puertas and BermÃºdez (2020)  incorporating a range of weighting factors and Wang et al. (2021)  for the entropy method. Unlike the above methods of calculating weights, this paper accounts for the hierarchical nature of the SDGs and uses hierarchical data envelopment analysis (H-DEA) to calculate the SDG CI, which assigns the most advantageous weights to each goal and indicator on basis of the dataset. To the authors' knowledge, there is currently no literature that applies this model to SDG performance assessment. H-DEA is applicable to assessment objects with a multilevel structure and can better reflect effectiveness at different levels, assist decision-making units (DMUs) in identifying opportunities for improvement, optimizing resource allocation and enhancing performance, and has wide application in agriculture (e.g., Chen et al., 2019; See et al., 2021 ), education (e.g., See et al., 2022; Thanassoulis et al., 2017 ), finance (e.g., Li and Chen, 2010; Tseng et al., 2008 ) and other fields (e.g., Shahari et al., 2023 ; See et al., 2024 ). H-DEA is unique in dealing with the analysis of the effectiveness of complex, multihierarchical dimensional structures, supporting managers in making more informed decisions through the scores and weights of indicators at each dimension. The application of H-DEA to SDGs highlights its originality and versatility in handling multidimensional structures. H-DEA comprehensively evaluates diverse goals, integrating multiple indicators to capture synergies and trade-offs. It supports evidence-based policymaking by identifying ineffectiveness and best practices, ensuring effective efforts toward SDGs. The detailed effectiveness scores of H-DEA facilitate continuous monitoring, trend identification, and intervention assessment, aiding in adaptive management. Its comprehensive, multidimensional analysis provides policymakers with crucial insights for informed decisions and sustainable development. The unique ability of H-DEA to address the complexity of SDGs makes it an invaluable tool for evaluating progress and country SDG performance. The SDG report assigns equal weights to each goal and every indicator, which is a rather subjective way of assigning weights and does not correspond to the realities of countries with very different contexts. H-DEA endogenously differentiated weights are superior to the above approach because they are derived from the objective principle of optimality. On the basis of the H-DEA algorithm, the model is based on a dataset that assigns a higher weight to the indicator when a country performs relatively well, whereas underperforming indicators may receive very low weights (Cherchye, 2001; Sahoo and Acharya, 2010 ). This endogenous weight helps DMUs prioritize improvements in indicators with high weights rather than treating the importance of indicators equally within the constraints of limited resources and thus improving future SDG performance more effectively. The contribution of this study to the literature is twofold. First, the H-DEA model calculates the SDG scores of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries with endogenous objective weights, avoiding a homogenous national sustainable development context. Second, the weights and scores obtained by each OECD country can be used to describe how much improvement should be made in each goal and each indicator to improve SDG performance. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2  provides a brief review of the literature related to the SDGs. In Section 3 , the research methodology of the H-DEA model and the hierarchical structure of the SDGs are presented. Section 4  presents the empirical results of the study for the 2020â2022 period for more than 30 OECD countries. Section 5  summarizes the findings and conclusions and provides recommendations for future work.  2 Literature review The SDGs are a continuation and extension of the MDGs, and if the MDGs are the telescope through which developing countries are viewed, then the SDGs are the mirror that reflects the policies and performance of high-income countries themselves (Kroll, 2015 ). With the support of the Bertelsmann Foundation, the SDSN published the SDG Index for the first time in 2015, with a study of OECD countries, to assess the performance of rich countries on the SDGs and to highlight the special responsibility of OECD countries in this regard. Since 2016, the annual SDG report published by the SDSN has expanded the use of DMUs for performance assessment to include countries globally, and due to the availability of data for OECD countries, the annual Sustainable Development Report has added variation for these countries, creating an augmented SDG Index. This paper takes OECD countries as the subject of the study to evaluate the results of these high-income countries' efforts in terms of the SDGs to suggest directions for improvement and optimization to accelerate the completion of the 2030 Transformation Goals. 2.1 Literature review on sustainable development performance in OECD countries Several studies address the assessment of sustainable development performance in OECD countries. The main study focuses on SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy): Sinha et al. (2023)  proposed a new energy transition index that utilizes a two-step system generalized method of moments approach and data from 37 OECD countries for the period 2000â2019 and found that social imbalances dampen the positive impacts of energy transition drivers, while the quality of governance contributes to enhancing these impacts. Bashir et al. (2020)  studied the impact of export diversification on energy efficiency in OECD countries. DoÄan et al. (2022)  studied the impact of import product diversification on energy efficiency in OECD countries. Hu et al. (2022)  explored the impact of environmental technology innovations as well as various policy regimes on energy transition and suggested a policy framework to align climate change adaptation and mitigation policies to achieve sustainable development goals. Using second-generation methods and dynamic elasticity analysis, Zhao et al. (2022b)  found that structural transformation and technological innovations contribute to reducing inequality in renewable energy productivity and that conflict and economic conflict are detrimental to inequality in renewable energy productivity in OECD countries. Other studies have examined single SDG, such as SDG9 (e.g., Abbas et al., 2024 ), and multiple SDGs (e.g., Dam et al.,2023 ). To the authors' knowledge, only two papers have examined the 17 SDGs and produced composite scores and rankings of the SDGs for OECD countries: Mordeson et al. (2020)  ranked OECD countries on their achievement of the SDGs based on the 2015, 2017, and 2019 SDG Index Report data using three methods: Analytic Hierarchy, Guiasu and Yen Methods. GarcÃ­a- PeÃ±a et al. (2022)  argued that the five pillars of the 2030 Agenda (People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnership) could be compared with the four pillars of the integrated sustainable development (Social Inclusion, Economic Development, Environmental Protection and Governance), so the 17 SDGs were categorized into four dimensions, further constructing the 4D Expert SDG Index and completing the SDG Index using the balanced index. They based the 2020 SDG Index Report dataset on OECD countries and analyzed whether they are developing in a balanced way. Although both papers give SDG scores and rankings for OECD countries, they do not indicate specific directions for improvement for each DMU's goals and indicators. In contrast, the H-DEA model used in this study takes into account the multilevel structure of the SDG index and allows not only the overall effectiveness of each DMU to be derived but also the effectiveness of each level's goals (indicators) to be assessed, helping managers and decision makers identify the key goals (indicators) affecting overall effectiveness and take more targeted improvement measures.  2.2 DEA application in SDG assessment DEA was first proposed by Charnes et al. (1978)  and was improved upon by Banker et al. (1984) . Since then, DEA models have been widely used and researched, becoming an essential tool in the field of performance assessment. DEA is a nonparametric performance assessment method that can consider multiple input and output indicators together and endogenize weights from the database. The relative efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) can be calculated to provide more accurate, objective and credible performance assessment results (Cook and Seiford, 2009; Cooper et al., 2011; Seiford and Thrall, 1990; Zhou et al., 2008; Zhu, 2003 ). DEA is a powerful quantitative analysis tool that not only assesses a DMU's ability to convert its inputs into outputs but also generates a composite index for situations where no inputs or outputs are available (Blancas et al., 2013; Kao, 2010, 1994; Liu et al., 2011; Lovell and Pastor, 1999 ). The DEA model has the advantages of a nonparametric nature, efficiency assessment capability, multi-indicator handling capability, comparability, and relative efficiency comparison, making it a powerful tool for measuring performance and efficiency. Although no studies have has used the DEA model to aggregate 17 SDGs into a composite index, some studies have applied this method to the study of one or several SDGs.  Table 1  provides the relevant literature in which the sample covers multiple countries and studies one or more SDGs.  2.3 Current study and comparative analysis Weights play a crucial role in determining composite indicator outcomes. Mohebali et al. (2020)  and Abdella et al. (2021)  highlighted the importance of establishing weights for individual indicators when defining composite indicators. These weights are often subjectively determined and influenced by internal consistency and validity issues within reviewing committees (Falagario et al., 2012 ). Alternatively, expert judgment, public opinion, or equal weighting may be used, although this approach is less common (Zhou et al., 2007 ). Equal weighting or expert judgment is commonly applied in research to establish SDG composite indices. However, due to significant variations in SDG performance among countries, weights must reflect contextual differences in regional economic development and cultural background. Statistical methods such as factor analysis, as noted by Abdella et al. (2021) , are used to define weights, capturing common information among indicators. The entropy method is another commonly used technique for calculating CI scores, especially when dealing with subjective weights or incomplete information. However, these weights are uniform across participating units, irrespective of individual performance. In contrast, H-DEA, a nonparametric technique, captures diverse unit performances. DEA defines an efficiency frontier, comparing the performance of partipanting units against it and assigning weights accordingly. Hence, weights vary among units, reflecting differences in composite indicator scores. Takamura and Tone (2003)  highlighted how the DEA model shifts its focus to "effectiveness" when resource utilization is not considered in efficiency measurements. Yu et al. (2021)  classified two H-DEA models: efficiency-based (Kao, 2015; Li et al., 2021 ) and effectiveness-based (Blancard and Hoarau, 2011; Lozano and Gutierrez, 2008; Shahari et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2021, 2022; Yu and Hsiao, 2016 ). Past studies favored effectiveness-based H-DEA, developing composite indicators for DMUs using only indicator scores as outputs, akin to the benefit-of-the-doubt (BoD) technique proposed by Melyn and Moesen (1991) . This method aggregates indicators into a single composite index, offering advantages over traditional methods. It addresses multidimensionality, eliminates subjectivity in weight determination, and calculates flexible "optimal" weights. The H-DEA approach, which is based on the BoD concept, makes no statistical assumptions and adopts an "optimistic" perspective. It is user-friendly and suitable for small datasets. Integrating the BoD concept in H-DEA methods ensures accurate indicators. The CI can combine multiple indicators in SDG assessments, simplify the assessment process, provide comparability, and support decision making; therefore, many scholars have constructed composite indicators to assess the overall performance of countries and regions in SDGs (Diaz-Sarachaga et al., 2018; Hametner and Kostetckaia, 2020; Lamichhane et al., 2021; Lior et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020 ). Some scholars have focused on several SDGs, such as SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) (e.g., Chishti et al., 2023; Coscieme et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023 ), SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) (e.g., Masi et al., 2018; Soto-Rios et al., 2023; Venkatesh and Velkennedy, 2023 ) and SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) (e.g., Bailey et al., 2023; Binsaedan et al., 2023; Tayebi et al., 2023 ). Many scholars have also studied the relationships between SDGs, with significant positive correlations between pairs of SDGs referred to as synergies and significant negative correlations referred to as trade-offs. For example, Warchold et al. (2021)  concluded that SDGs 1, 5 and 6 are associated with linear synergies, whereas SDGs 3 and 7 are associated with nonlinear synergies. The study by Xiao et al. (2023)  not only derived significant synergistic and trade-off goals but also assigned weights to each SDG. These scholars generally conclude that the synergistic effects between SDGs are greater than the trade-off effects (Gannon et al., 2022; Pradhan et al., 2017 ), with Xiao et al. (2023)  are concluding that the share of SDG synergistic effects is as high as 98.33â¯%. There is also a large body of literature that examines the relationships between SDGs and other areas, such as the correlation between circular economy (CE) practices and SDG implementation (e.g., Lahane and Kant, 2022; Puntillo, 2023; Schroeder et al., 2019; Walker et al., 2021 ), the impact of the ocean blue economy on SDGs (e.g., Islam and Shamsuddoha, 2018; Nash et al., 2020; Tirumala and Tiwari, 2022 ), and the interrelationship between the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) and SDGs (e.g., Esses et al., 2021; Ionescu-FeleagÄ et al., 2023 ). The global consensus and importance, multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary nature, diversity and complexity, and practical and policy orientation of SDGs have led to a large body of relevant literature, which provides insights and understanding of SDG implementation and impact and provides important references and guidance for policy development, practice and academic research. However, no existing studies employ the H-DEA model to create a comprehensive index of SDGs and leverage the distinct benefits of the DEA model to evaluate country performance. This study addresses this gap, offering a more objective and comprehensive foundation for policy formulation, resource allocation, and decision prioritization.   3 Methods and data This paper focuses on solving all 17 SDGs and creating a new sustainability index for more than 30 OECD countries. The UN Sustainable Development reports for 2020â2022 were used to categorize and select variables (Sachs et al., 2020, 2021,2022 ). Based on the data reported for the above three years and the absence of variables, the 17 SDGs consist of 112 indicators, with the specific indicators under each SDG detailed in Appendix A . In multiattribute decision making (MADM), the process involves assessing decision alternatives against multiple criteria or attributes to establish a ranking. However, in practical MADM scenarios, the absence of accurate weight data for these criteria or attributes can introduce uncertainty when determining the rankings or overall scores of decision alternatives. To address the MADM problem of calculating attribute or criterion weights, this paper employs the H-DEA method proposed by Yu et al. (2021)  to determine preference relations among all decision alternatives by computing objective weights. Notably, the goals and indicator scores of SDGs are outputs and are not related to input resources, so measurements in nonproduction environments are more appropriate for this study. Therefore, similar to Takamura and Tone (2003)  and See et al. (2024) , the DEA in this paper does not address the resource utilization required to assess efficiency and thus is aimed at "effectiveness" rather than "efficiency". The conventional DEA is based on multiple inputs and outputs to measure the relative efficiency of DMUs. The effectiveness-based H-DEA model, where each subindicator is treated as an output with no other inputs so that all DMUs are presumed to have uniform virtual incomes (Cook and Kress, 1990; Fernandez-Castro and Smith, 1994 ), is better suited for the performance assessment of SDGs in nonproduction environments. SDGs are hierarchical in structure overall, and the effectiveness-based H-DEA model embeds a hierarchical structure in the one-stage hierarchy of the conventional DEA model, which allows for better comparison of the overall performance of DMUs with multidimensional indicator sets. The H-DEA model transforms SDG assessment by assigning optimal weights based on the BoD technique, reducing bias for accurate cross country comparisons. It not only computes CI scores but also derives weights for each hierarchy, offering actionable insights for policymakers to prioritize efforts effectively. Statistical validation confirmed its alignment with UN SDG practices, highlighting its reliability. Identifying performance leaders provides valuable benchmarks for emulation. Moreover, by providing relative efficiencies and weights, it enables optimized resource allocation, enhancing SDG achievement. To show how robust the proposed model is, a sensitivity analysis is performed on the weights assigned to the indicators related to the SDG and its specific target. Through these mechanisms, the H-DEA model serves as a robust decision support tool, empowering policymakers with the intelligence needed to drive sustainable development efforts efficiently and effectively across nations. For convenience in illustrating the relationships between decision attributes (SDGs) and their criteria (indicators), we adopt a hierarchical structure diagram to describe the MADM problem with SDGs. The hierarchical structure diagram of SDG performance among EU countries is shown in  Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 1 , the hierarchical structure diagram consists of three levels: the first level is the MADM problem with complete information, the second level is the decision attribute of the MADM problem, and the third level is the evaluation criterion for the decision attributes. This diagram is similar to the hierarchical structure diagram of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). However, unlike AHP, in H-DEA, the weights of decision attributes and evaluation criteria are not determined through pairwise comparisons. Instead, they are obtained through the calculation of objective evaluation criteria using the H-DEA model. Fig. 1  depicts the hierarchical structure representing each SDG and criterion. Let us assume that there are I (i = 1 , â¯ , I   ) SDGs at Level 2, and each criterion corresponds to an indicator j  i     (denoted as (c  j  i       (j  i   = 1 , â¯ , J  i     )). In other words, at Level 3, we have J  i     indicators associated with each respective SDG. To construct the composite index, a set of weights is necessary to aggregate all the SDGs and indicators across different levels. On the basis of the aforementioned structure, the objective function for each DMU k â²  = 1 , â¯ , K   can be expressed in a nonlinear programming model as follows:(1) Î¸ k â²   =  max  â i = 1  I  w i  ( â j i  = 1  J i   w j i   c j i  k â²   )  = â i = 1  I  â j i  = 1  J i   w i  w j i   c j i  k â²        Subject to(1.1) â i = 1  I  w  i   â j  i   = 1  J  i     w  j  i      c  j  i   k    = â i = 1  I  â j  i   = 1  J  i     w  i   w  j  i      c  j  i   k    â¤ 1 , k = 1 , â¯ , K ,     (1.2) â i = 1  I  w  i    c  i k   â¤ 1 , k = 1 , â¯ , K ,     (1.3) â j i  = 1  J i   w j i   c j i  k   â¤ 1 , i = 1 , â¯ , I , k = 1 , â¯ , K .      In this context, w  i     and w  j  i       represent the weights assigned to indicators related to SDG i   and its specific indicator j  i    , respectively. These weights are typically determined by each country to maximize the overall performance of the composite index Î¸  . Constraints (1.2) and (1.3) are included to guarantee that the aggregation values do not exceed one at any level. To maintain the index value within the range of zero to one, the problem can be addressed by incorporating the following constraints for country k'.(1.4) â j  i    J  i     w  j  i      = 1 , i = 1 , â¯ , I ,     (1.5) â i = 1  I  w  i    = 1 ,     w  i   , w  j  i     â¥ Îµ , i = 1 , â¯ , I , j  i   = 1 , â¯ , J  i   .      Moreover, to multiply both sides of constraints (1.3) and (1.4), w  i     is employed in the following manner.(1.6) w  i   â j  i   = 1  J  i     w  j  i      c  j  i   k   â¤ w  i   , i = 1 , â¯ , I , k = 1 , â¯ , K .     and(1.7) w  i   â j  i    J  i     w  j  i      = w  i   , i = 1 , â¯ , I .      Model (1) is considered nonlinear because of the presence of nonlinear terms such as w  i   w  j  i     ( i = 1 , â¯ , I , j  i   = 1 , â¯ , J  i   )   . However, it can be linearized by performing variable transformations, such as w  i   w  j  i     = w Ë   j  i       , and by multiplying the constraints associated with scaling restrictions with suitable variables. This linearization process yields the following model. In accordance with Chen et al. (2019) , we convert the aforementioned nonlinear programming model into a linear programming model. Thus, Model (1) can be expressed as follows:(2) max  â i = 1  I  â j  i   = 1  J  i     w Ë   j  i     c  j  i   k â²           Subject to(2.1) â i = 1  I  â j  i   = 1  J  i     w Ë   j  i      c  j  i   k    â¤ 1 , k = 1 , â¯ , K ,     (2.2) â j  i   = 1  J  i     w Ë   j  i      c  j  i   k   â¤ w  i   , i = 1 , â¯ , I , k = 1 , â¯ , K ,     (2.3) â j i  J i   w Ë  i j i    = w i  , i = 1 , â¯ , I ,     (2.4) â i = 1  I  w  i    = 1.     w  i   , w Ë   j  i     â¥ Îµ , i = 1 , â¯ , I , j  i   = 1 , â¯ , J  i   .      To prevent the optimal weights of indicators from becoming zero, the following restrictions are applied to Model (2).(2.5) w  i   * 1 J  i     * ( 1 â Î± ) â¤ w Ë   j  i     â¤ w  i   * 1 J  i     * ( 1 + Î± ) ,  j  i   = 1 , â¯ , J  i   , i = 1 , â¯ , I ,     (2.6) 1 I  * ( 1 â Î± ) â¤ w i  â¤ 1 I  * ( 1 + Î± ) , i = 1 , â¯ , I ,     where the parameter 0 â¤ Î± â¤ 1    is preassigned and can be determined by the decision maker. A higher value of A indicates a greater degree of flexibility in the weighting decision. Based on Model (2), each country k is granted the ability to select optimal weights to maximize the composite indicator Î¸  k     while ensuring that the calculated composite indicators for all countries are either less than or equal to one. By solving K linear programming problems (where K represents the total number of countries), the weights of the SDGs and indicators will vary among the DMUs. Consequently, different SDGs and indicators will carry varying weights for each country. At the optimal solution, the score S D G  i k  *   ( i = 1 , â¯ , I )    for each SDG and the composite indicator Î¸  k  *     for each country k are determined using the optimal values of w  i  *   , w Ë   j  i    *   , i = 1 , â¯ , I , j  i   = 1 , â¯ , J  i     . The calculation for S D G  i k  *   ( i = 1 , â¯ , I )    is given by Eq. (3) , whereas Eq. (4)  represents the calculation for Î¸  k  *    .(3) S D G  i k  *   = â j  i   = 1  J  i     w  j  i    *    c  j  i   k   â¤ 1 , i = 1 , â¯ , I , k = 1 , â¯ , K ,     (4) Î¸  k  *   = â i = 1  I  w  i  *    S D G  i k  *   â¤ 1 , k = 1 , â¯ , K ,     where w  j  i    *   = w Ë   j  i    *    w  i  *       .  4 Results 4.1 A comparison aggregates the SDG indicators between reports and the H-DEA model This study reevaluated the SDG index using 3 editions of the Sustainable Development reports dataset (2020, 2021, 2022). The 2020 edition of the Report studies 36 OECD countries, with the addition of Colombia and Costa Rica in 2021 and 2022, respectively, so the corresponding reports are ranked 37th and 38th, respectively. To illustrate the robustness of the H-DEA model, a sensitivity analysis is summarized in  Table 2 , which presents the average of the effectiveness scores obtained by moving the H-DEA weights up and down from 0â% to 90â% based on the UN weights. The greater the up-and-down range is, the greater the effectiveness score obtained. The sensitivity analysis reveals that under given weights, the smaller the allowable adjustment range of the weights is, the more consistent the results are with those under the given weights. Conversely, the larger the allowable adjustment range of the weights is, the greater the difference from the results under the given weights. This conforms to the principle of model setting, indicating the robustness of the model. Thus, different weights affect the SDG effectiveness scores, illustrating the importance of weights in evaluating the development of SDGs in each country. The SDG effectiveness scores of OECD countries from 2020â2022 obtained in this paper are based on the WB weights and are adjusted by 50â%.  Table 3  describes the descriptive statistics of the sustainability index scores of the 17 SDGs obtained using the H-DEA methodology. Interestingly, from 2020 to 2022, in all three study periods, the highest mean effectiveness score was for SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), and the lowest two mean effectiveness scores were for both SDG17 (Partnerships for the Goals) and SDG9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). It is also evident from the skewness and kurtosis results in Table 3  that the majority of the 17 SDGs have Z skewness and Z kurtosis values that are not between â1.96 and +1.96, indicating that the dataset does not conform to a normal distribution.  Table 4  shows the Pearson correlation analysis between the H-DEA results at the 1â%, 5â%, and 10â% significance levels, which reveals that there is a linear correlation between most of the SDGs, which is consistent with the results of Gannon et al. (2022) , Pradhan et al. (2017) , Ronzon and SanjuÃ¡n (2020) , and Xiao et al. (2023)  in which the synergistic effect (significant positive correlation) is greater than the trade-off effect (significant negative correlation) between the SDGs. We compare the results of the H-DEA model with the corresponding editions of the Sustainable Development Report to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Our first concern is whether there is a significant change in the rankings of OECD countries, and  Table 5  shows the specific rankings of OECD countries according to the reports and the H-DEA model. As highlighted in Section 3 , the main difference between the algorithm proposed in this paper and the SDG report is the different weights of each goal (indicator). Based on our observations, the endogenous optimal weights change the rankings of OECD countries as follows: 97.2â% (35) in 2020; 94.6â% (35) in 2021; and 78.9â% (30) in 2022. It can also be seen that the effectiveness-based H-DEA model changes the rankings of most OECD countries, such as Iceland, France, Austria and Chile, all of which have changed more than five places in the rankings over three years, whereas the remaining countries have not changed their rankings as significantly. In terms of the geographic location of OECD countries, the top third (top 12) of the H-DEA model for the three years 2020â2022 are from Europe, with Latin American and Caribbean countries generally ranking lower. In terms of income levels, based on the World Bank classification criteria, we classify households into four income levelsâhigh income (H), upper middle income (UM), lower middle income (LM), and low income (L)âaccording to the atlas method with GNI per capita using a sample from 2020â2022. All the countries are high-income countries, except for Mexico, Turkey, Colombia and Costa Rica, which are upper-middle-income countries and are at the bottom of the list. To verify the differences in the rankings of OECD countries between the SDG reports and the H-DEA and because the SDG indices are nonnormally distributed, this study uses the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test (Wilcoxon, 1992 ) and the Spearman correlation rank test. From  Table 6 , the rankings of the 2020, 2021 and 2022 UN reports are not significantly different from the results of the H-DEA, suggesting that the framework proposed in this paper is consistent with the SDG practices of the UN Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform, demonstrating the applicability of the model. The core idea of DEA is to identify relatively efficient and inefficient DMUs by constructing an effectiveness frontier and reference set, calculating a relative effectiveness score for each DMU using a linear programming model, and providing directions for improvement for inefficient decision units, where the effectiveness score is between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating the highest effectiveness and 0 indicating the lowest effectiveness. The results are detailed in    Tables 7, 8 and 9 , and the rankings of countries in Table 5  are obtained by ranking them according to the high or low effectiveness scores of the total SDG index. From Tables 7 , 8 , and 9 , we can see that except for Mexico and Colombia, all the countries have scores above 0.7, and almost two-thirds have scores above 0.8. To visualize the differences between the benchmark study (Sachs et al., 2020, 2021, 2022 ) and the H-DEA rankings more visually, a scatter plot of the rankings was drawn and is shown in  Fig. 2 . The results reveal that the rankings of the top performing countries (i.e., Sweden, Denmark and Finland) and the underperforming countries (i.e., Israel, Greece, Mexico, Turkey and Colombia) of the H-DEA and the benchmark study are almost identical. The remaining countries that are neither at the top nor the bottom differ significantly from the benchmark study's rankings, such as France, Austria and the Iceland. There are also countries that show minimal differences, such as Greece, Ireland, Estonia, and the Czech Republic.  4.2 Changes in SDG development in OECD countries, 2020â2022  Fig. 3  depicts the changes in OECD country rankings from 2020 to 2022 based on the H-DEA model. Some countries have significantly increased in the rankings, such as Luxembourg by 10 places, Greece by 5 places, Germany by 4 places, and the United Kingdom by 3 places. Conversely, some countries have fallen in the rankings, such as Belgium, Hungary, and Lithuania, each by 5 places, and Japan and Canada, each by 3 places.  Fig. 4  depicts the evolution of the SDG composite index effectiveness scores for OECD countries from 2020 to 2022. The countries that have improved significantly in terms of effectiveness are Luxemburg and Greece, and the countries that have decreased significantly are Sweden, Denmark and Lithuania.  Fig. 5  presents the overall average effectiveness scores of the 17 SDGs for 2020, 2021, and 2022. The data indicate that SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) have been more efficient and stable over the past three years. In contrast, SDG9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and SDG17 (Partnerships for the Goals) exhibit lower efficiency, with SDG17 showing a declining trend. Notably, SDG1 (No Poverty) and SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) have demonstrated varying degrees of effectiveness improvement, reflecting the OECD countries' efforts to enhance their performance on these SDGs.  4.3 Analysis of the weights of the SDGs (indicators) derived from the H-DEA model The H-DEA weights, which represent the relative importance of each goal and indicator, are not only a key element of the effectiveness scores of SDGs but also a measure of future improvements for OECD countries, which can improve their SDG performance scores more effectively by devoting limited resources and greater effort to higher weighted goals (indicators). The weights in the UN Sustainable Development reports are given subjectively and equally, whereas the weights in the H-DEA model are derived based on the dataset, with Kao (2010)  naming the former a priori weights and the latter a posteriori weights. The a posteriori weights in H-DEA are more convincing than the reports' a priori weights because they are derived after all the data have been collected and represent the focus of the alternative criteria being assessed. The H-DEA model in this paper assigns the optimal weights for each of the SDG (indicator) levels.    Tables 10, 11 and 12  present the weights of the 17 SDG levels for the 2020 (36), 2021 (37), and 2022 (38) OECD countries, respectively. The weights of the SDG level vary across OECD countries due to differences in the level of SDG development in each country due to differences in context and conditions. For example, in Germany, the weights for SDG1, SDG2, SDG6, SDG7, SDG8, SDG11, SDG15 and SDG16 are 0.0882, the weight for SDG10 is 0.588, and the weight for the remaining goals is 0.0294, which indicates that the country wants to increase its level of SDG development more efficiently and should prioritize its efforts and resources on SDG1, SDG2, SDG6, SDG7, SDG8, SDG11, SDG15 and SDG16, which are weighted goals. In contrast, in France, SDG1, SDG5, SDG6, SDG7, SDG10, SDG11, SDG13, and SDG16 are weighted at 0.0882, while the remaining goals are weighted at 0.0294. Both countries are economic powerhouses in Europe and are committed to fully advancing sustainable development, and both countries have environmental efficiency scores in energy R&D that are very close to the efficiency frontier (KoÃ§ak et al., 2021 ). However, there are some differences in the focus of the two countries on implementing SDGs, and policymakers and regulators need to differentiate in the development of policy frameworks and action plans to help them achieve SDGs more efficiently. On the other hand, since the development of SDGs is dynamic and spiralling in each country, the weights for 2020, 2021 and 2022 are not the same, even for the same country and the same goal. For example, Austria's weight for SDG13 in 2021 will be 0.0882 and will reach 0.0294 in 2022, whereas the weight for SDG8 will change from 0.0294 to 0.0882, indicating that the country should focus more on SDG8.  Fig. 6  shows the average weights of the 17 SDGs for 2020â2022. As shown in Tables 10â12  and Fig. 6 , most OECD countries have larger weights for SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) in 2020â2022. With global population and economic growth, water scarcity and water pollution have become increasingly global challenges (SDG6) and have resulted in a dependence on fossil fuels and increasing energy demand, increasing the importance of the development of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency (SDG7). In addition, the importance of SDG16 is highlighted in the current context of rising global challenges, increasing social instability and pressures on global governance. Moreover, there is a significant upward trend in the weight of SDG 1 (No Poverty) and a downward trend in the weight of SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), as shown in Fig. 6 . Widening economic inequality, the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, and policy and resource allocation are reasons why the importance of SDG1 is increasing significantly in OECD countries. This is not only a need for OECD countries to address domestic economic and social challenges but also a need to fulfill international commitments and promote global sustainable development. The remarkable advantage of the H-DEA model is that the best weights are assigned separately for the goals and indicator levels, enabling countries to determine which enhancements would be most beneficial in improving their overall effectiveness score and ranking. The endogenous best weights provide the basis for prioritizing improvements across the 17 SDGs and their subindicators and can assist decision makers in assessing and comparing effectiveness and performance across units to make more informed decisions, a critical piece of information that is not available from the UN Report.   5 Discussion and implications There are a number of scholars in the literature who calculate composite indices of SDGs to assess the performance of sustainable development in various countries. For example, Guijarro and Poyatos (2018)  introduced a goal-planning model to rank the performance of sustainable development in the EU28; Wang et al. (2020)  aggregated 17 composite indices of SDGs with the same weights to evaluate the status of sustainable development in 31 provinces in China; and Carrillo (2022)  used the geometric mean to compute the indicator weights and construct a composite index to assess the performance of sustainable development in EU countries. As mentioned in the literature review section, Mordeson et al. (2020)  and GarcÃ­a- PeÃ±a et al. (2022)  calculated and ranked the SDG scores of the OECD, where Mordeson et al. (2020)  ranked the SDGs by converting the indicators and data provided by the 2015, 2017, and 2019 SDG reports into a fuzzy logic setup with no intersection of data with this paper, as shown in Appendix B . However, GarcÃ­a- PeÃ±a et al. (2022) , based on the 2020 SDG Index Report dataset, constructed a 4D experiment SDG (4D-ESDG) index by dividing the 17 SDGs into four dimensions and ranking the OECD countries using a balanced index; therefore, this index can be checked against the results of this paper. Interestingly, 4 of the top 5 countries ranked by H-DEA and 4D-ESDG are the same (Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway), and 4 of the bottom 5 countries are also identical (Mexico, Turkey, Greece, Israel). In general, with the exceptions of Austria, Netherlands, Switzerland, the Slovak Republic, Ireland, Latvia and Lithuania, the rankings of the remaining countries do not differ by more than 5 degrees. Despite the consistency of the results, the current research methods in the literature and the UN report are not able to give a performance ranking similar to that of the H-DEA model in this paper and at the same time indicate the direction of improvement and optimization for each country through the endogenous weights. For example, for Australia, the importance of the 17 goals is not exactly the same, and it is clear that under the constraints of limited resources, investing more resources in SDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 16 can significantly improve the country's performance ranking in terms of sustainable development. The weights of the indicators under the 17 goals also provide countries with more specific and clear policy preferences and more efficient ways to enhance their performance rankings. It can also be seen from Table 5  that the effectiveness-based H-DEA model changes the rankings of most OECD countries, such as Iceland, France, Austria and Chile, all of which have changed more than five places in the rankings over three years, while the remaining countries have not changed their rankings significantly. One of the possible explanations for the small change in the rankings of most countries is that the sustainable development performance of OECD countries has historically been better than that of the other countries, as these are the most industrialized and developed countries, also leading in most of the three dimensions of SD (presence of a high share of European countries). In addition, Table 5  shows that the rankings of Iceland, France, Austria, Chile, the United Kingdom, and Poland in the H-DEA model differ significantly from the SDG report rankings. There are two reasons for this: on the one hand, despite the large difference in rankings, the difference in scores is not significant; for example, France is ranked 14th in the H-DEA in 2020 and 4th in the SDG report, a difference of 10 places. However, in 2020, France's effectiveness score was 0.834, and the 4th place score was 0.869, a difference of just 0.035. On the other hand, endogenous weights play an important role. For example, in 2021, Iceland was ranked 6th in the H-DEA and 27th in the SDG report. By comparing Table 8  and Table 11 , it can be seen that the highest weights in Table 11  are assinged to SDG1, SDG3, SDG4, SDG6, SDG7, SDG8, SDG10, and SDG16. Among these goals, Iceland's scores for SDG1, SDG3, SDG7, SDG10, and SDG16 are all greater than 0.9. Specifically, SDG1 is 0.994, SDG7 is 1.00, SDG10 is 0.970, and SDG16 is 0.958, which are the top scores among OECD countries. Thus, in the endogenously weighted effectiveness H-DEA model, Iceland is one of the top-performing OECD countries. This study also revealed that the SDG score is influenced by geographic region and income level. Countries in different geographical regions face different challenges and conditions. Those in the top third (top 12) are all European countries. Although most of the OECD countries are European, Europe's excellent geographic location plays an important connectivity role in the realization of SDGs. In addition, all these European countries, except Norway, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Iceland, belong to the European Union, which actively promotes the realization of SDGs through policies, funding, cooperation and advocacy and is committed to promoting sustainable economic, social and environmental development; making efforts to build a more prosperous, just and balanced world; and making important contributions to the cause of global sustainable development. In contrast, Latin American countries such as Colombia and Costa Rica are affected by natural disasters, ecological vulnerability and other factors and face more challenges in implementing SDGs. In terms of income level, Gani (2023)  suggested that the GNI per capita has a positive effect on the realization of SDGs, while Rathnayaka et al. (2024)  suggested that financial support should be expanded to achieve SDGs. The bottom of the ranking in Table 5  belongs to the middle- and high-income countries, whereas the remaining countries are high-income countries, which also confirms the viewpoints of the above scholars. Assessing the SDG performance of OECD countries is of paramount importance, and this paper adopts H-DEA for this purpose with the following important implications: On the one hand, an objective weight is incorporated. Unlike the subjective treatment of the SDG report where each indicator is assigned an equal weight, the H-DEA model incorporates an objective weight to ensure the comparability and accuracy of the index. This model account for the hierarchical nature of the SDGs themselves while avoiding subjectivity in the results of comparisons and provides an alternative option for comparing the SDG rankings of countries. On the other hand, optimizing resource allocation and policy decisions: The H-DEA model provides the relative effectiveness and weights of 17 SDGs and 112 indicators for each OECD country, which provides guidance for policy makers to optimize resource allocation and policy decisions. By recognizing goals and indicators with high weights, policymakers can target and adjust resource allocation and strengthen policy support to improve the effectiveness of SDG achievement. This paper has the following policy implications for OECD countries. First, geographic region and income level affect the ranking of SDGs. To promote the development of SDGs, OECD countries should make full use of the advantages of location to carry out cross-border trade and other aspects of cooperation and increase income through a variety of favorable policies. Second, some OECD countries, such as Belgium, Hungary, and Lithuania, have declined the most from 2020 to 2022, and these countries are in five places. These countries should have more limited resources to allocate to the weight accounting for a large proportion of the country's goal score, which is relatively low. For example, Belgium has a large weight of SDGs 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15 and 16, of which SDGs 5, 6, 7 and 16 do not have an advantage in terms of score, so the Belgian government should formulate and implement policies to focus on the improvement of these goals. Third, most OECD countries have the largest weights for SDG6, SDG7, and SDG16 in 2020â2022, and these indicators, with a large share of weights, have an important impact on SDGs; thus, SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) are crucial for OECD countries, and countries should formulate relevant policies to focus on these goals.  6 Conclusions The composite index can combine data from multiple indicators or dimensions and provide a comprehensive performance assessment result, which enables managers and decision makers to better understand the actual situation of performance, set clear objectives and adjust their strategies and actions according to changes in the composite index. The weight allocation of the composite index has a large effect on the final performance assessment results, and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the weight allocation is an important challenge for the composite index. The effectiveness-based H-DEA model proposed in this paper has the following advantages. H-DEAâs flexible weight assignment allows for greater customization based on the specific context and priorities of the analysis. This means that it can better align with the specific strategic objectives and operational nuances of the entity being evaluated. The additional advantage of the H-DEA method, in addition to being able to assign weights to goals and individual indicators from given data, is that it also avoids some criticisms of the subjective weights required by traditional methods. For example, traditional multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods often rely on the subjective opinions of experts to determine criterion weights, which raises several concerns. First, the weight assignment process by experts may be influenced by personal biases, leading to a lack of objectivity in the results. Second, differences in the knowledge background and experience of different experts can result in inconsistent and unreliable weight distributions. Additionally, the process of collecting and integrating expert opinions is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and it is challenging to invite a sufficient number of experts to ensure representativeness in large decision-making problems. These issues undermine the effectiveness and credibility of MCDM methods in practical applications. In contrast, the H-DEA method automatically generates weights from data, avoiding the subjectivity and inconsistency issues mentioned above. The model is based on the UN Sustainable Development Report datasets for OECD countries from 2020â2022 and divides the structure into three levels: overall, goal, and indicator. The endogenous objective weights for the goal and indicator levels aid countries in identifying the key drivers of SDG improvement and aggregate the hierarchical effectiveness indices into an overall composite effectiveness index for the OECD. The results suggest that the effectiveness-based H-DEA model changes the rankings of most OECD countries and that Iceland and Austria change their rankings by more than 10 places. However, there is a significant correlation between H-DEA and the UN SDG index after the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Spearman correlation rank test, confirming the applicability of the model in this paper. The model endogenizes the optimal weights for each of the 17 goals and 112 indicators for each OECD country across different datasets and contexts, pointing to specific directions for optimization and improvement. Although there are numerous methods, including entropy in Huang (2023)  and the AHP in Kumar et al. (2022) , for calculating weights to measure SDG progress, the adoption of a new approach such as H-DEA can offer distinct advantages. First, H-DEA provides a hierarchical perspective that may better capture the complexities and interdependencies within SDGs, offering a more nuanced analysis. Additionally, while H-DEA itself may not be entirely novel, its application to the analysis of SDGs is relatively new and holds promise for providing unique insights. The decision to utilize H-DEA was likely driven by its potential to address the limitations of existing methods and to offer a fresh perspective on SDG analysis. Although the novelty of the study may appear limited on the surface, the exploration of new methodologies is essential for advancing research and improving our understanding of complex global challenges. Overall, the DEA approach, which is based on a hierarchical view, is more suitable for governments and policy makers for SDG monitoring and performance measurement and has various contributions in practical applications, such as providing performance identification and comparison, indicator weight assignment, effectiveness improvement and resource optimization, and strategic decision support. This approach is a powerful tool and method for achieving SDG tracking, evaluation and optimization. This study has several limitations, and the following three aspects can be considered for future research. First, the inclusion of data from OECD countries and developing countries poses a challenge due to data availability, and a simultaneous study of SDGs in developing countries could be considered in the future when more comprehensive data are available. Second, the H-DEA in this paper uses flexible weights, and if fixed weight techniques are considered in future studies, hierarchical analysis and entropy methods could be explored. Additionally, strategies such as dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis or factor analysis could be employed to transform the original criteria into a smaller set of uncorrelated factors, thereby reducing the number of dimensions and improving the model's manageability and interpretability. Third, because some targets may lack corresponding indicator data, this paper does not incorporate the target level. The use of more comprehensive data to accurately reflect each target in the future, including target level analysis, is a research direction worth exploring.
