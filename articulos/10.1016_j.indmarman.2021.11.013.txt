                  The United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals provide business to business marketing (B2B) scholars with a useful framework to guide research with a societal impact that addresses real-world challenges and is relevant to stakeholders outside academia. Although sustainability research within B2B marketing scholarship has increased in recent years, the B2B literature relating to the Sustainable Development Goals remains fragmented and underexposed. To address this important oversight, a systematic literature review of the B2B marketing literature (n = 58) is undertaken which demonstrates if and how B2B scholarship is currently engaging with the Sustainable Development Goals. The findings and analyses highlight that although the B2B scholarship has varying levels of engagement with some of the goals, there is vast opportunity for B2B Marketing scholars to engage more proactively and strategically with the Sustainable Development Goals. Building on the call for courageous research and employing the ‘Observe, bridge and challenge” model (Lindgreen et al., 2021), we develop broad research approaches as well as specific research questions to catalyse scholarship at the interface of B2B Marketing and the Sustainable Development Goals.

The United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals provide business to business marketing (B2B) scholars with a useful framework to guide research with a societal impact that addresses real-world challenges and is relevant to stakeholders outside academia. Although sustainability research within B2B marketing scholarship has increased in recent years, the B2B literature relating to the Sustainable Development Goals remains fragmented and underexposed. To address this important oversight, a systematic literature review of the B2B marketing literature (n  = 58) is undertaken which demonstrates if and how B2B scholarship is currently engaging with the Sustainable Development Goals. The findings and analyses highlight that although the B2B scholarship has varying levels of engagement with some of the goals, there is vast opportunity for B2B Marketing scholars to engage more proactively and strategically with the Sustainable Development Goals. Building on the call for courageous research and employing the ‘Observe, bridge and challenge” model (Lindgreen et al., 2021), we develop broad research approaches as well as specific research questions to catalyse scholarship at the interface of B2B Marketing and the Sustainable Development Goals.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  B2B marketing  Systematic literature review  Sustainability    1 Introduction Recent calls by scholars in business (RRBM, 2021 ) and marketing (Bolton, 2021 ; Chandy, Johar, Moorman, & Roberts, 2021 ; Lindgreen, Di Benedetto, & Kock, 2021 ; Voola, Carlson, Azmat, & Sinha, 2021 ) encourage reimagining the purpose of business by broadening its goals beyond profits to include societal outcomes—specifically, to move beyond shareholder value to equally prioritize consumers, suppliers, employees, and the broader community. There have also been calls by national governments and international organizations such as the United Nations (UN) for businesses to engage proactively with social issues. For example, the UN states that ‘it is both ethical and good sense to invest in sustainable development for all people on a healthy planet’ (UNCC, 2019 , para. 3). In the marketing literature, these macro debates have resulted in an increased focus on sustainability (e.g., Sun, Bellezza, & Paharia, 2021 ; White, Habib, & Hardisty, 2019 ). The B2B literature has started to engage with sustainability, including in relation to branding (Czinkota, Kaufmann, & Basile, 2014 ), big data (Sivarajah, Irani, Gupta, & Mahroof, 2020 ), business networks (Lacoste, 2016 ) and the environment (e.g. Mariadoss, Tansuhaj, & Mouri, 2011 ). Sharma (2020)  provided an excellent summary of the limited B2B sustainability literature and called for further research on sustainability in the B2B context given its predominant focus in consumer research. As highlighted by Sharma (2020) , the lack of focus by B2B marketing scholars on sustainability is surprising considering the increasing expectations of stakeholders for B2B firms to engage in sustainability. Further, because of the economic importance of the B2B sector, which is predicted to be worth $US10.6 trillion by 2023 (Bonde, Bruno, Wu, Ruhl, & Birrell, 2019 ), the B2B sector affects various aspects of society, including employment and societal wellbeing. For example, Schneider Electric is bringing changes to the lives of many unemployed, vulnerable people in India by training them in electrical installation and maintenance (Schneider Electric, 2021 ). Given the nature of B2B markets, as opposed to B2C markets, it can be argued that B2B markets are more intuitively aligned with sustainability issues. For example, a) employment provided by B2B firms may play a major role in alleviating poverty in certain sections of society; b) B2B firms focused on ethical supply chain management may address modern human slavery challenges; (c) inclusive hiring practices in B2B may have significant impact on inequities and (d) a focus on sustainable production and consumption of good and services by B2B firms, may advance environmental sustainability. Therefore, we argue that there is a unique opportunity for contemporary B2B marketing scholars to take a courageous approach to sustainability research (Lindgreen et al., 2020 ) as well as a ‘Better Marketing for a Better World’ approach (Chandy et al., 2021 ) and to adopt a more holistic and critical approach to sustainability. This includes questioning the assumptions relating to the purpose and the role of a B2B firm in society, as well as the notion that only certain sustainability issues are relevant to B2B markets. Furthermore, these approaches will allow B2B scholars to engage in innovative, novel, and unconventional ways to address various societal problems that have traditionally been ignored or overlooked in the B2B marketing domain. Sustainability has been operationalized well by the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (George, Howard-Grenville, Joshi, & Tihanyi, 2016 ). These 17 goals were developed in 2015 by the UN and include 169 targets that provide a road map to a better world by 2030 (UN, 2021 ). Fig. 1   highlights the 17 SDGs (the UN link provides extensive details on the SDGs and its targets) and Appendix 1 provides details of 169 targets, that relate to each of the 17 goals. Although sustainability is being addressed as an area of academic inquiry in the B2B marketing literature, with the advent of the SDGs and their acceptance at various levels (i.e., the UN, countries, and companies), it is surprising that B2B marketing scholars have had limited focused engagement with the SDGs. Such a focus on the SDGs in B2B marketing scholarship is imperative for several reasons. First, Lindgreen et al. (2020)  called for B2B marketing scholars to engage in research that has greater societal value. Specifically, the authors highlighted and encouraged the shift of knowledge production from Mode 1, which is ‘academic, disciplinary, and homogeneous’, to Mode 2, whereby research is transdisciplinary and socially accountable, and emphasizes application (p.2). They also suggested that research should contribute positively to the broader economy and society as well as uplifting countries, firms, and individuals (ESRC, 2020 ). It can be argued that the SDGs provide a framework for B2B marketing scholars to engage in Mode 2 knowledge production because explicit engagement with the SDGs, which emphasize application, and their 169 targets will have a societal impact beyond the B2B context. Second, there has been a growing call by B2B scholars to engage proactively with research that is relevant to society and practice (e.g., Mittal & Sridhar, 2020 ; Ritter, 2019 ). Dziubaniuk et al. (2021)  went further and suggested that for B2B research to be relevant and to better build a bridge between scholars and practitioners, it has to be readable: ‘accessible language is imperative to prevent academic papers from being difficult to read and too abstract to understand for non-academic audiences’ (p. 225). Although there is a growing body of scholarship on sustainability, by not extending this rich body of literature on sustainability specifically to the UN SDGs, B2B scholars are at risk of missing a valuable opportunity to participate in the meta-narrative of the world, which is important to various stakeholders (e.g., governments and firms), and increasingly to marketing practitioners and students. Addressing the SDGs and the related targets provides one avenue to address concerns about the relevance of B2B marketing literature to managerial practice and the needs of society (Business Roundtable, 2019 ). Finally, Lindgreen et al. (2021)  called for research on problems revealed through real-world observations, in which original, interesting and courageous research ideas can be identified. The SDGs are a culmination of extensive collaboration between the UN, governments, and companies. Given this, we argue that a deliberate focus on the SDGs, and research questions relating to each of the 17 SDGs (and associated targets), will provide B2B scholars with greater opportunities to engage in critical research that has societal value, relevance and readability, and the potential to lay the foundation for further courageous research to occur. To lay the foundation for ‘courageous research’, it is first pertinent to understand how existing research in the B2B area has engaged with the SDGs. This paper builds on Sharma's (2020)  work on sustainability to provide an overview of the B2B marketing literature in relation to the SDGs. By mapping what is known in the field, this review lays the groundwork and identifies gaps and opportunities for future research to build upon. To this end, the broad research objective guiding this study is to understand how the B2B marketing literature engages with the SDGs. This research objective is supported by three specific research questions:1. How does the B2B sustainability literature map on to the 17 SDGs?  2. What are the knowledge gaps in B2B marketing in terms of achieving the SDGs?  3. What are the future research directions for B2B marketing engagement with the SDGs?    To address these research questions, we reviewed 58 articles published in leading marketing journals. Following a systematic literature review (SLR) (Hulland & Houston, 2020 ; Palmatier, Houston, & Hulland, 2018 ; Tranfield, Denyer, & Smart, 2003 ), we mapped the reviewed papers to provide an overview of the field, identified gaps and advanced research questions to guide future research inquiries. Our descriptive analysis and synthesis lead to the classification of the articles in terms of the: (1) publication year, (2) methods used, (3) study locations, and (4) interaction between B2B marketing and SDG related topics. Moreover, based on our thematic analysis, we draw out the following major themes: (1) robust relationships, (2) innovations purposed for sustainability, (3) sustainability positioning and marketing communications, and (4) sustainability and its discontents. This paper is structured as follows. We first present the methodology of our SLR on SDGs and B2B marketing. Second, we provide descriptive information relating to how the SDGs map to eight B2B marketing topics (i.e., Managing relationships/networks in business marketing , Managing innovation and new product development , Business marketing communication , Branding/image (or reputation) building , Supply chain management , Organizational buying behaviour , Sales and sales management  and Macro marketing strategy ). Third, we provide the key themes at the intersection of B2B and SDGs arising from our descriptive analysis. Finally, we provide future directions for B2B scholars on how SDGs can be better integrated with B2B marketing research.  2 Research methodology The purpose of this review is to map the current state of research on B2B/industrial marketing and the SDGs and to identify inconsistencies and knowledge gaps in order to provide directions for scholars. To this end, a systematic approach was taken to ensure comprehensiveness, rigour, transparency, and replicability (Rousseau, Manning, & Denyer, 2008 ; Tranfield et al., 2003 ). Following previous reviews published in Industrial Marketing Management  (e.g., Bouazzaoui, Wu, Roehrich, Squire, & Roath, 2020 ; Raddats, Kowalkowski, Benedettini, Burton, & Gebauer, 2019 ) and guided by Moher et al.'s (2009)  PRISMA guidelines, we adopted a four-stage approach (identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion) in our SLR. In the identification stage, a keyword search was conducted to locate potentially relevant articles published in ABDC A and A* ranked marketing journals. The next step, screening, included scanning the titles and abstracts of the identified entries (n  = 10,581) for relevance, guided by the inclusion/exclusion criteria. This was followed by a critical appraisal, the eligibility step, of the screened articles (n  = 69) to determine suitability for inclusion in this review. The final step, inclusion, involved 58 articles included in the review being separated out. The following sections provide further insights into the four stages of the systematic review methodology. 2.1 Identification To ensure robustness and rigour, a systematic search protocol (see Fig. 2  ) was developed to identify relevant, high-quality articles. The protocol established the scope and boundary of the search process. Although the SDGs were developed by the UN in 2015, we did not use a predefined period for searching articles. We adopted this approach because B2B marketing scholarship has a tradition of engaging with sustainability and has inherent links to the SDG framework. For instance, Rivera-Camino (2007)  examined green marketing in a B2B context that links to SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and SDG 12 (Responsible Production and Consumption) even though such nomenclature did not exist in 2007. Given our focus on the B2B marketing–SDG interfaces, we considered articles with indicators from both these areas that were published before August 2020. To maintain the quality of the articles in our review, we focused exclusively on articles published in ABDC (Australian Business Deans Council, 2019 ) marketing journals with an A* and A ranking. Therefore, we performed our keyword search across 49 journals (filtered by using ABDC field of research code 1505). This strategy has been adopted in previous SLRs (e.g., Donthu, Kumar, Pattnaik, & Campagna, 2020 ; Grossmann, Mooney, & Dugan, 2019 ; Zengul, Byrd Jr, Oner, Edmonds, & Savage, 2019 ) because the ABDC list features premier academic outlets. Our decision to focus on marketing journals was based on the key research objective of this review, which is to understand how the B2B marketing literature engages with SDGs. We limited our search to empirical, conceptual and literature review articles within the B2B marketing domain. Therefore, we did not consider conference proceedings, dissertations, editorials, commentaries, books, or unpublished works in this review. The search string (see Fig. 2 ) was derived from the overall research objective of this paper and by referring to search terms used in reviews on related topics (see Caiado, Leal Filho, Quelhas, de Mattos Nascimento, & Ávila, 2018 ; Sharma, 2020 ). Keyword combinations used in the search were (B2B marketing OR Business to business marketing OR Industrial marketing AND Sustainable Development Goal OR SDG OR sustainability OR Green OR Environmental OR Corporate Social responsibility). In total, our search returned a total of 10,581 entries.  2.2 Screening In this stage, the title and abstract of the 10,581 entries were manually reviewed for relevance to the research objective. According to our specific focus on SDGs in the B2B marketing context, we developed a criterion for exclusion. Excluded from this review were studies that (a) did not investigate issues that could be broadly subsumed under the SDG framework within the B2B or industrial marketing context, (b) focused solely on B2C relationships or (c) were editorials or research notes. We focused only on works related to social and environmental sustainability, because they fall within the remit of the SDGs, and excluded studies that focused exclusively on business sustainability, competitive advantage, or the like. In addition, we went through the references of selected articles to further identify relevant works. However, this additional step did not add to the final list of articles. We also cross-referenced our results with recent reviews (e.g., Mio, Panfilo, & Blundo, 2020 ; Sharma, 2020 ) on related topics to explore whether important articles had been missed. Overall, the screening process resulted in 69 articles.  2.3 Eligibility In the eligibility stage, all 69 articles were appraised for suitability for inclusion, using the goals and targets listed in the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN, 2021 ). Each author independently reviewed the full text of all the articles to validate the content's relevance to the core research focus of B2B/industrial marketing for sustainable development. To enable discussion between the authors, key information, including purpose, method, and key findings, of each of the 69 articles was extracted, documented (in tabular form) and shared. This was done to ensure a minimum level of reviewer bias and maintain a level of uniformity in the article selection process. The research team discussed and resolved minor differences and decided jointly on the selection of the final set of articles for this review. This enabled the research team to compare the content of each article with the SDG and B2B indicators to confirm the relevance of the match. We observed that some of the articles only superficially alluded to SDGs or B2B marketing and did not meet our eligibility criteria. Therefore, we omitted articles that mentioned either the SDGs or the B2B marketing as secondary concepts. By employing such inclusion/exclusion criteria, a further 11articles were deemed non-eligible for inclusion (see Fig. 3  ).  2.4 Inclusion Following the process outlined above, a final set of 58 articles published in 12 journals met the screening and eligibility criteria and were identified as relevant for this review. Employing a two-pronged inductive and deductive approach, we first identified topics covered in the 58 articles through our analysis and synthesis. Further, we matched these topics with the established literature on B2B marketing (Cortez & Johnston, 2017 ; Hutt, Sharma, & Speh, 2014 ; LaPlaca & Katrichis, 2009 ) to document the categories, areas, and topics within the SLR. This process allowed the research team to systematically compile eight key B2B marketing topics represented within the 58 articles, which could then be mapped onto the 17 SDGs (Appendix 2 provides a systematic map of 58 journal articles and its relationship to B2B marketing topics, SGD goals and related targets).   3 Descriptive analysis In this section, the key descriptive results from the SLR are presented with a commentary about trends and patterns within the literature. Our analysis of the literature revealed key insights on (a) main outlets and the timeline of the publications, (b) research designs, (c) study locations and (d) coverage of SDG-related research issues in the B2B marketing literature. 3.1 Main outlets and the timeline of the publications Appendix 3 provides a summary of the distribution of the articles across journals. As shown in Appendix 3, the selected publications appeared in 12 journals, and Industrial Marketing Management  and the Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing  accounted for the vast majority (62% and 17%, respectively) of publications. Both the journals are B2B/industrial marketing related, indicating that other mainstream marketing journals are relatively silent on the implications of SDG related aspects on marketing strategies and operations. This suggests that there is scope for other top marketing journals to proactively engage with these topics, going forward. Further, by categorizing publications into 10-year periods, it became evident that limited research on the topic was available in the first four periods, as illustrated in Fig. 4  . Not surprisingly, the number of publications steadily grew from 2011 onwards, from eight papers in 2001–2010 to 50 papers in 2011–2020 (525% increase). This dramatic rise reflects the increasing importance of SDG-specific topics in the B2B marketing context, and with the trend of SDG-related discussions and initiatives by public and private organizations during this period after it was first announced in 2015. For example, Fig. 4  shows that 31 articles (53%) were published in 2016 (post the UN SDG announcement) or later, indicating the trajectory of interest in this area of research.  3.2 Research design As shown in Fig. 5  , the research designs of the identified studies highlight the emphasis on conceptual (n  = 11) and case study (n  = 12) approaches. Such a trend is understandable given that this field of research is still emerging, and testable theories are yet to be constructed. However, as depicted in Fig. 5 , in recent years, researchers have started to adopt survey methods (n  = 8, in 2019 and 2020). Such moves towards theory testing and validation (through rigorous quantitative studies) and theoretical development (through grounded theory and phenomenology) in the past two years, point towards the growing interest of researchers with different research paradigms. To our surprise, very few studies (n  = 5) used mixed-method approaches, indicating a significant methodological gap.  3.3 Geographic locations Fig. 6   highlights that a high share of the studies originate from European countries (n  = 20, 35%), while only 5% (n  = 3) of studies are based in South America and Oceania. Considering the need to implement the SDGs in developing countries, it is surprising that very few studies have explored those regions (e.g., Africa and Asia). Our analysis of articles further indicates that many of the studies in our sample are country specific, indicating the scope for more cross-cultural studies.  3.4 Linkages between B2B marketing and SDGs We now turn to our findings on linkages between the B2B marketing literature and SDGs. Fig. 8  (Page no: 24) presents a Sankey diagram that provides a visual representation of the links between the key B2B marketing areas and the 17 SDGs. This diagram is based on the analysis and synthesis of the reviewed articles (see Appendix 2) to show which B2B marketing and SDG-related issues have been covered in the extant literature, and which have been omitted. The width of the links represents the strength of association between these two areas. Therefore, the higher the frequency of the B2B marketing topic–SDG combination, the thicker the connection. The high frequency value (n  = 64) illustrates that many these studies engaged with SDG 12, Responsible Production and Consumption, in different B2B contexts. As shown in Fig. 8 , nearly half (8 out of 17) of the SDGs have been addressed in the existing B2B marketing literature. In terms of coverage of SDG-related issues in B2B marketing scholarship, our analysis indicates that many key SDGs, such as education, health, education, gender equality and several others, have been overlooked. Nevertheless, this provides opportunities to develop new knowledge and contribute to these significant gaps in research within these areas.   4 Theme analysis: Nature of relationship between B2B scholarship and SDGs The SLR identified four important themes depicting the nature of the relationship between B2B marketing areas of research and the SDGs. They are discussed in this section with supporting evidence (see Table 1   for a detailed summary). Furthermore, please refer to appendix 1 for the SDGs and targets. 4.1 Theme 1: robust relationships Research on marketing relationships and networks among business entities is well established in the field of industrial marketing (LaPlaca & Katrichis, 2009 ). The articles in this SLR focus on specific kinds of relationships, namely, partnerships with stakeholders engaged in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. These partnerships range from within the sector, that is, B2B buyers, sellers, suppliers, employees, and shareholders, to across sectors, including governments, non-profits, and academia. For instance, examining the state of CSR in Australia, Truscott, Bartlett, and Tywoniak (2009)  found that only a well-developed CSR industry supported by government, community and businesses will encourage corporate commitment to social responsibility. In other words, CSR strategies that are inward-looking, with limited exchange across sectors, are unlikely to gain shareholder buy-in for sustainable development. This B2B scholarship on marketing relationships can be clearly mapped onto specific SDG goals. For instance, the partnerships across public–private sectors map onto SDG 17—specifically Target 17.17, which encourages effective public, private and civil society partnerships (UN, 2021 ). As expected, articles in this review also explore relationships and networks among business entities, especially those related to supply chains that can be directly associated with SDG 9, Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. Target 9.4 within this goal discusses the industrial ecosystem and the need to upgrade all industries, infrastructures, technologies, and processes for sustainability. B2B marketing research examines in depth the nature of relationships within the industrial ecosystem and the potential for sustainability. For example, research has found that stakeholders within the industrial ecosystem play a significant role in influencing the green marketing strategy of organizations and markets (Rivera-Camino, 2007 ), and therefore, framing stakeholder considerations is an important component of sustainability in business networks (Svensson et al., 2016 ). Stakeholder theory has emerged as an important framework to examine the types and quality of B2B marketing relationships, and researchers are calling for a shift from shareholder partnerships to stakeholder partnerships to steer firms ‘away from the invisible hand of free markets and consumption-driven marketing, towards the visible hand of guided markets and sustainable consumption’ (Sheth & Sinha, 2015 , p. 86). In addition to discussing various types of partnerships for sustainability, articles in the review provide critical assessments of the authenticity of such partnerships. Crisafulli, Dimitriu, and Singh (2020)  found that social innovations that are launched via partnerships with non-profits are positively evaluated by organizational buyers, eliciting perceptions of warmth, competence, and higher purchase intentions. Nevertheless, the motivation for such alliances (Müller, Habel, & Stierl, 2017 ), the credibility of collaborations (Hoejmose, Brammer, & Millington, 2012 ) and issues of trust (Talay, Oxborrow, & Brindley, 2018 ) and fairness (Mutch & Aitken, 2009 ) have been called into question by scholars. Investigating fairness in CSR partnerships among companies and non-profits, Mutch and Aitken (2009)  explored who holds power in the relationships and why justice matters. Honing in on the principles underpinning the partnerships, they called on companies to self-examine whether they are being seen to be fair or are fair. They concluded that marketing has a significant role in clarifying and representing this difference to develop proactive, trusting, and robust relationships.  4.2 Theme 2: innovations purposed for sustainability Innovations and new product development are an important research area in B2B research (Cortez & Johnston, 2017 ) and emerged as a significant theme in this review. This area of research regarding innovations for improved sustainability map onto SDG 9, Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, which calls for an upgrade in industries and infrastructure to promote innovative sustainable technologies. For instance, in their exploration of innovations to improve integration of green marketing with supply chain management, Liu, Kasturiratne, and Moizer (2012)  found that sustainability-based innovations improve overall business performance against the triple bottom line objective of people, planet and profit. Specifically, Targets 9.5 and 9.B within this goal encourage enhanced scientific research to upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries. Supporting this association between innovations for sustainability and SDG 9 is an article by Genç and Di Benedetto (2015)  exploring the impact of upgrading technological capacities in B2B contexts. The authors surveyed 219 firms engaged in sustainable new product development projects, across three stages of concept development, product development and product commercialization. Their findings revealed that integrating environmental specialists into traditional new product development teams (often composed of functional specialists, including manufacturing, marketing, and R&D personnel) has a positive effect on high-innovation projects. In addition to improving firm performance on sustainability, such innovations raise the sustainability standards in the B2B context. Articles in this review provide a straightforward link to SDG 12, Targets 12.2 and 12.5, which call for the sustainable management and use of natural resources as well as substantially reducing waste generation (UN, 2021 ). For instance, Mariadoss et al. (2011)  found that firms that employ innovations with the purpose of sustainability can generate environmentally sustainable behaviours within the industrial ecosystem of employees, customers, and suppliers. Following an examination of the sustainability-based innovation of 47 B2B firms, they reported sustainable behaviours such as the increased purchase of pro-environmental products by industrial customers, cost, and waste reductions due to change in recycling and reuse behaviour, and suppliers and customers following sustainability principles while executing the contract (p. 1312). They also noted that such behaviours create a competitive advantage for firms in terms of cost savings, profits, market share or brand equity. In a similar vein, Ranta, Keränen, and Aarikka-Stenroos (2020)  examined the potential to innovate for novel value creation opportunities in B2B markets by optimizing resource usage and reducing waste. While innovation is commonly associated with technological discoveries, within the SDG framework, innovations include building policy environments inter alia, industrial diversification and value addition to commodities (SDG 9, Target 9.B). In observing value addition to commodities and services in B2B contexts, Lacoste (2016)  found that firms that co-create value with their business customers and their customers' customers are able to develop supplier–customer networks that share sustainability targets. Clearly, innovative value co-creation requires collaborations, and some B2B research has delved deeper into the topic. For instance, Babu et al. (2020)  examined the drivers for social innovations via sustainable strategic alliance among commercial and non-profit organizations. Their research concluded that value is an outcome of the ‘interaction and exchange of ideas, knowledge and resources amongst various parties which also leads to successful innovation’ (p. 23). Therefore, social innovations without value co-creation call into question the sustainability motivations of the firm.  4.3 Theme 3: sustainability positioning and marketing communications Marketing strategy is a broad and important research topic within the B2B literature (Sharma, 2020 ), and specific elements of overall marketing strategy such as branding, positioning and communications emerged within the current SLR. After exploring environmental sustainability practices in B2B contexts, Vesal, Siahtiri, and O'Cass (2020)  asserted that manufacturing firms with positive environmental attitudes can generate a positive brand image and market performance. In other words, sustainability positioning is key in the overall marketing strategy of B2B firms to engage with SDGs. Likewise, De Ruyter, De Jong, and Wetzels (2009)  employed the term environmental stewardship as a positioning strategy for business markets. They found that B2B teams with shared beliefs about improving environmental conditions can affect organizational sales performance. Such research integrating traditional organizational performance measures with environmental concerns map easily onto SDG 12, Targets 12.2 and 12.6, which encourage companies, particularly large and transnational companies, to espouse sustainable business practices and to incorporate sustainability data into their reporting cycle. Studies have found that sustainability positioning can lead to positive, negative and in some instances, complementary brand image (Ben Youssef, Leicht, Pellicelli, & Kitchen, 2018 ). For instance, in their conceptual paper on integrating sustainability and branding, Kumar and Christodoulopoulou (2014)  made a case for firms with sustainability in their core mission to invest in branding activities that accentuate the firm's sustainability practices and their impact on stakeholders. Previous B2B-specific research has found that strong brands yield a price premium, reduce information costs and risks, boost recommendations among B2B customers and positively affect new product introductions (Bendixen, Bukasa, & Abratt, 2004 ; Persson, 2010 ). Therefore, sustainability positioning in B2B firms can lead to a positive brand image. However, Brennan, Binney, McCrohan, and Lancaster (2011)  found that when the sustainability rhetoric does not match business practice, a negative brand image could be established for the firm. Based on content analysis of organizational websites belonging to the top 30 organizations listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, the authors found very little congruence between the intentions and the actions related to CSR, environmental sustainability, and ethical codes of conduct. They concluded that despite being the top companies in the country, they had garnered a reputation of ‘green-washing’. One of the core elements of marketing strategy is communication and promotion, and the articles in this SLR focused on this aspect. Kapitan, Kennedy, and Berth (2019)  found that it is insufficient to have a branding platform without communicating a firm's sustainability positioning to stakeholders. In the context of B2B firms, they asked two key questions: (a) How do B2B buyers perceive the sustainability of their supply chain partners? (b) How can B2B marketers more clearly assess and articulate their own sustainability positioning? (p. 85). Their research provides theoretical development of what it means for an organization to be either more or less sustainable, and whether it can effectively and transparently communicate this to its stakeholders. Such line of research maps onto SDG 12, which calls for responsible consumption and production of natural resources to reverse or minimize the harms inflicted on the planet. Specifically, marketing communications and promotions of the firm's sustainability positioning can be linked to Target 12.8, which calls for universal understanding and awareness of sustainable lifestyles in harmony with nature.  4.4 Theme 4: sustainability and its discontents While the SDGs are often framed in a positive and aspirational light, B2B research provides rich insights into the negative and often challenging aspects of sustainability in practice (Brindley & Oxborrow, 2014 ; Cheng & Sheu, 2012 ; Ramirez, Gonzalez, & Moreira, 2014 ). This is an important theme to emerge from the SLR, which provided real-world examples of industrial actors aspiring to address ‘wicked problems’ such as poverty and climate change. Unexpectedly, this theme appears to fill a significant gap within SDG discourses, which are often abstract and lack practical grounding, despite having specific goals and targets. We argue that the B2B literature adds depth to the SDG framework by examining tensions, barriers, challenges, and failures in adopting sustainability. For instance, Tura, Keränen, and Patala (2019)  explored how sustainable business practices lead to various types of tensions and conflicts. This issue maps onto SDG 9, Target 9.4 which alludes to the industrial ecosystem and the management of networks within it. In a qualitative multiple case study in a regional business network including interviews with 43 managers in 17 firms in different industries in Finland, the authors exposed tensions categorized as economic, structural, psychological and behavioural, with network actors categorized as implementers, suppliers, customers and other network partners. While acknowledging that network partnerships are drivers of sustainability goals, they provided a cautionary note against the potential ‘dark side’ effects and called for further research on how to anticipate, manage and mitigate them. Similarly, Press, Robert, and Maillefert's (2019)  research on partnerships for sustainability, which maps onto SDG 17 seeking to develop global partnerships for sustainable development, provided concrete examples of how some partnerships can have opposite effects. Using case studies of companies in the energy sector, such as ArcelorMittal, they found that the outputs, outcomes, and impact of sustainability projects are not equally good for everyone. While ArcelorMittal positions itself as a key innovator in industrial ecology, such as by converting industrial gas emissions into electricity, it has ongoing tensions with residents and environmental advocates regarding the poor air quality resulting from its manufacturing projects. Deeper insights regarding such paradoxes were made evident in research by Sallnäs and Huge-Brodin (2018)  on logistic service provider–shipper relationships in transport and logistics. This research, which maps onto SDG 12 (Targets 12.2 and 12.6) found that environmental practices can flourish and fade within such relationships. Therefore, paradoxes provide a useful theoretical lens to illuminate the complexity of logistics and supply chains in the ‘greening’ of these relationships. Another example of sustainability intention with inconsistent practice outcomes was presented by Borchardt, Ndubisi, Jabbour, Grebinevych, and Pereira (2019)  in their examination of base of the pyramid (BoP) approaches. These approaches relate to SDG 1, which seeks to eradicate extreme poverty (Target 1.1) and reduce poverty by at least 50% (Target 1.2) (UN, 2021 ). Their review of the role of multinational enterprises in addressing poverty in developing countries found an ongoing and interactive tension between poverty alleviation and profitability. Borchardt et al. (2019)  argued that while multinational enterprises make quality-of-life improvements in the short or medium term within BoP contexts, they leave behind negative impacts in the long run. This is because these enterprises only address surface-level issues of access to consumption, infrastructure, education, and the like, but fail to redress the root causes of social inequalities. Consequently, B2B research engaging with SDGs needs to critically examine the tenuous line between sustainability outcomes and profit-making outcomes. The false and simplistic binary of ‘either the company achieved SDGs or failed’ needs to be re-examined, and more nuance in this research stream is required.   5 Discussion and approaches for future research Although B2B marketing scholars have begun to engage with the SDGs, this engagement is at a nascent stage of development. Despite calls for B2B marketing scholars to intentionally engage with sustainability and research that has societal value, only 4 of the 35 papers published since 2015, within our dataset, explicitly make a reference to the UN SDGs (i.e., Ferro, Padin, Høgevold, Svensson, & Varela, 2019 ; Kapitan et al., 2019 ; Press et al., 2019 ; Sharma, 2020 ). It is also important to note that there is increasing evidence of sustainability's link with a firm's competitive advantage and innovation outcomes. For example, Klein, Spieth, and Heidenreich (2021)  provide evidence of sustainability commitment of a firm and innovative outcomes, via certain firm strategic orientations. To this end, both the link of sustainability to traditional performance outcomes as well as the call for B2B marketers to engage with research that has societal value provides compelling reasons to directly engage with the SDGs. We adapt the “Observe, bridge and challenge” model (OBC model) to guide our discussion of the findings from the SLR and to provide avenues for further research (Kock, Assaf, & Tsionas, 2020 ; Lindgreen et al., 2021 ). The OBC model (See Fig. 7  ) is ideal for catalysing research at the interface of B2B marketing scholarship and the SDGs because it advocates that original and courageous research is best founded on insights from observing the real world and by bridging disciplines. It can help B2B scholars to consider engaging with the SDGs, as societal issues require engaging with ideas from other disciplines, outside of marketing and business (e.g., Olwig, 2021 ; Sachs et al., 2019 ) particularly in relation to real world events like COVID-19. We encourage B2B scholars to approach SDG research with an attitude of questioning assumptions. This includes questioning assumptions at a broad philosophical level, (i.e., the purpose and role of business in society, the relevance of B2B scholarship, and how the B2B sector can engage with the evolving expectations of business to do good) and at a micro level (i.e. whether the dominant theories and research methods adopted by B2B marketing scholars are sufficient for engaging with the SDGs and how B2B firms can engage proactively and strategically with the SDGs?) Questioning assumptions is particularly salient because societal issues encapsulated by the SDGs are not a traditional mainstay of B2B scholarship. 5.1 Observing the world: Implications of SDGs for B2B marketing (“outside-in approach”) This section focuses on future research from an outside-in approach, where the “phenomena generally evident in the world potentially have relevance for business marketing efforts” (Lindgreen et al., 2021 , p.2). Increasingly businesses, including B2B firms, are challenged to re-imagine the purpose of business and to move from a narrow shareholder focus to a more inclusive stakeholder focus. This shift in focus provides a fertile ground for B2B marketing scholars to engage with “observing the world” to inform B2B marketing scholarship on the SDGs. As shown in the Sankey diagram (Fig. 8  ), the focus of B2B marketing scholarship has been mainly on Sustainable Consumption and Production (SDG 12), Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9), and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17). This could be due to the obvious connect between these specific SDGs and B2B marketing landscape. For example, with the increasing importance of climate change, SDG 12 has become a priority in B2B marketing. Further, the traditional focus of B2B marketing scholarship on partnerships aligns well with SDG 17. The Sankey diagram suggests that there are many other SDGs that B2B marketing scholars can engage with. For example, no study in our sample focused on key SDGs such as hunger, education, gender equality, sanitation, and clean energy. It is amply evident from the current news and our observations of the world, that humanity is faced with a multitude of societal issues such as hunger, lack of clean water, lack of affordable energy, financial illiteracy, climate risk, and various inequities, especially in a post-covid world. There is an opportunity for B2B marketing scholars to engage with these real events and contribute to the field by showcasing B2B marketing activities and strategies with positive societal impact. Although the Sankey Diagram highlights that some SDGs are more aligned with the B2B sector, we encourage B2B marketing scholars to challenge existing assumptions about B2B Marketing and find opportunities in novel societal problems. B2B managers need to see themselves and their firms as part of the bigger planetary system and realize that long-term financial success depends not just on superior products and services, but a business model that is more stakeholder-oriented. For instance, SDG 6 related to clean water and sanitation, demonstrates that water scarcity is a sustainability challenge. This is an opportunity for B2B marketers to respond proactively and strategically. Managers need to consider how water conservation and storage can be optimized and its implications for new product development. Going forward, water optimized B2B solutions are likely to appeal more to industrial customers and governments alike. For example, B2B companies such as Suez are re-imagining their firm strategies by building coalitions that spans International Forums (World Economic Forum) and other firms such as Electrolux and P&G in order to respond to the water crisis (www.50lhome.org ). There is an opportunity for researchers to study how B2B firms can engage in building multi-sector coalitions to effectively engage with the SDGs. Therefore, taking the outside-in approach, B2B marketing scholars can examine the following research questions (see Table 2  ).  5.2 Observing the world: implications of B2B marketing for SDGs (“inside-out” approach) Another approach for marketing scholars to be inspired by the OBC model is based on an inside-out approach, or ‘some observed phenomena may be more immanent to business marketing, but also extend beyond it’ (Lindgreen et al., 2021 , p. 2). Thematic analysis in section 4 and Table 1  allows for an inside-out approach to understand those B2B topics strongly embedded in B2B marketing scholarship which may also extend beyond the discipline and potentially inform the SDG space. The thematic analysis found four key themes;1) Robust relationships; 2) Innovations purposed for sustainability; 3) Sustainability Positioning and Marketing Communications; and 4) Sustainability and its discontents. For example, the first theme, robust relationships, has a strong existing body of literature in the B2B marketing scholarship and the insights provided within this body of work may extend beyond marketing literature to potentially inform SDG 17 (Partnerships for Goals). SDG 17 is an integral part of the SDG framework. As the UN states that ‘The SDGs can only be realized with strong global partnerships and cooperation. A successful development agenda requires inclusive partnerships — at the global, regional, national, and local levels .’ (UN, 2021 ). Similarly in the context of the third theme, positioning and communications, David Attenborough, the noted naturalist in 2021 famously stated that saving our planet is now a communication challenge,  (BBC, 2020 ) suggesting that although the rationale (based on logic and science) for engaging with societal issues is clear, convincing, and persuading the various stakeholders is a difficult proposition. Marketing and B2B marketing inherently engage with the idea of providing a clear value proposition to the consumers and other stakeholders. In other words, marketing could be core to progressing the SDG Agenda and a response to David Attenborough's quandary. Therefore, employing an inside-out approach to observing the world, the following research questions (see Table 3   below) are suggested.  5.3 Bridging disciplines: research contexts, methods, and theories The OBC model states that ‘bridging disciplines can reveal original and courageous ideas, as well produce new theory construction if theories get redesigned to fit the new combined discipline” (Lindgreen et al., 2021 , p. 2). This approach encourages marketing scholars to proactively look beyond marketing into other disciplines within business and outside of business (e.g., economics, social policy, medicine). We argue that such an approach of proactively looking beyond the comfort of B2B specific theories and conventions will provide traction for B2B scholars to take on the research questions previously highlighted. Findings from this SLR (see Fig. 6 ) demonstrates that research relating to B2B marketing, and the SDGs is predominately emanating from scholars based in developed countries. This suggests an opportunity for proactive collaborations between B2B marketing scholars from developed and developing to partner on research relating to the SDGs. Proactive collaboration will help scholars to challenge assumptions, such as the notion that social inequities (e.g., poverty, good health) are more relevant in developing countries and environmental risks (e.g., climate risk) are more relevant in developed countries. Many of the B2B studies examining SDGs adopt a qualitative approach (Fig. 5 ), whilst some engage with survey research. This is because of the nascent nature of the engagement of B2B marketing with the SDGs. To expand the nature of this engagement, we argue for multidisciplinary methodologies, such as experimentation (randomized control trials) and ethnographic studies. For example, Zhang, Chintagunta, and Kalwani (2021)  use randomized control trials to investigate the adoption of eco-friendly pesticide in rural China. De Janvry, Sadoulet, and Suri (2017)  and Duflo and Banerjee (2011) , provide guidelines on this approach. There is also scope for ethnographic or immersive approaches to engage with the lived experiences of the different stakeholders in the B2B context. For example, in the context of agriculture and climate change, Rivera-Ferre et al. (2021)  argue that ethnographic studies based on an intimate study of a culture, allows for painting a picture of the socio-ecological system within which many agricultural practices are embedded. Finally, the SDGs are essentially societal issues. Traditionally, these have been primarily addressed by disciplines outside of marketing such as social policy and economics. For example, journals such as World Development and Nature Sustainability, provide new insights for B2B scholars in tackling the SDGs. Furthermore, depending on which SDG a scholar is focusing on, specific theories would provide unique insights. For example, B2B scholars examining SDG 1 (no poverty) could benefit from engaging with the capability approach to poverty (Nussbaum & Sen, 1993 ). Therefore, identifying theories that are important for SDG being examined from other fields would be advantageous to the B2B marketing scholar.   6 Conclusion The purpose of this paper was to document the scholarship at the interface of B2B marketing and the SDGs. To this end, an SLR was undertaken. The SLR revealed unknown gaps and unexplored opportunities for B2B marketing scholars to investigate. Specifically, the findings suggest that although there was an emergent interest in the SDGs, there was a lack of direction and depth to the future research agenda in this domain. To this end, this paper provided a ‘courageous, original’, and relevant research agenda for B2B marketing scholars to pursue, which we hope will catalyse research on the key sustainability challenges facing the planet. Addressing the SDGs is a global effort and B2B firms must identify its role within this global effort. We believe that B2B firms have a role to play in addressing the SDGs and therefore should be proactive, strategic and courageous in its outlook to contributing towards the SDGs.   Appendix 1.
