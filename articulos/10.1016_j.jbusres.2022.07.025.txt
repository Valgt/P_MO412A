                  This study analyzes the link between a firm's digital reputation and performance and the conditions under which its orientation towards sustainable development can moderate this link. The manuscript deals with relevant topics such as the digital tools that support the implementation of the firm's sustainability strategy, concerning the firm's commitment to deploying Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Using a sample of firms from the Fortune 500 list from 2015 to 2019, the findings show that digital reputation positively impacts a firm's financial and non-financial performance. Furthermore, results reveal that breadth (the variety of SDG-related themes covered) and concentration (the distribution of non-financial disclosure among the SDGs) operate as moderators in the above relationship. On the other hand, depth (the total volume of the SDG-based information) appears not to be significant. Finally, this study enriches the debate by providing a new data operationalization process to measure the firm's commitment to the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda.

This study analyzes the link between a firm's digital reputation and performance and the conditions under which its orientation towards sustainable development can moderate this link. The manuscript deals with relevant topics such as the digital tools that support the implementation of the firm's sustainability strategy, concerning the firm's commitment to deploying Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Using a sample of firms from the Fortune 500 list from 2015 to 2019, the findings show that digital reputation positively impacts a firm's financial and non-financial performance. Furthermore, results reveal that breadth (the variety of SDG-related themes covered) and concentration (the distribution of non-financial disclosure among the SDGs) operate as moderators in the above relationship. On the other hand, depth (the total volume of the SDG-based information) appears not to be significant. Finally, this study enriches the debate by providing a new data operationalization process to measure the firm's commitment to the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda.   Keywords Sustainable Development Goals  SDGs  Firm performance  Digital reputation  Non-financial performance    1 Introduction The topic of sustainability gained increased attention following the launch in 2015 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 Agenda by the United Nations, consisting of global and universal indicators for international cooperation and the collaboration of civil society, governments, multilateral institutions, and the private sector (Nam, 2015 ). The sustainable development framework includes 17 SDGs that embrace a wide range of environmental, social, and economic issues, including climate change, energy, biodiversity, food supply and security, sustainable production and consumption, healthcare, education, gender, equality, peace, and economic growth (Gupta & Vegelin, 2016 ). The SDGs provide objectives that governments, commerce, and civil society should pursue to create a sustainable future. This policy initiative changes the competitive and regulatory landscape for companies identifying corporate sustainability, innovative sustainability, and sustainable development strategic aims. In parallel to this evolution, the widespread adoption of digital technologies (e.g., social media, big data, cloud computing, industrial internet, cybersecurity) has expanded the firm's boundaries and communication, placing the company at the center of an increasingly information-intensive digital ecosystem (Nambisan, 2017; Nambisan et al., 2017 ; Verdoliva & Schiavone, 2021 ; Wang et al., 2020 ). Among these technologies, a relevant role is played by social media (e.g., Twitter), big data visualization, and analytics that enhances the creation of the digital reputation of firms, so impacting corporate performance (Hollebeek et al., 2014; Marrone & Hazelton, 2019; Ramos & Casado-Molina, 2021 ). The valorization of reputation can be seen as a way to increase economic returns (Fombrun, 2005; Holmlund et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016 ). In addition, digital technologies simplify data collection and the processing of corporate information, allowing companies to accomplish, among others, corporate reporting activities (Fiorentino et al., 2020 ). Different studies have suggested the leading role of digital technologies for sustainability in delivering multiple benefits to society and achieving the SDGs (Paiola et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2018 ). In the last decades, corporate reporting has been widely investigated by scholars assuming several research perspectives, focused on the different techniques, actors, and phases of the reporting journey (De Villiers et al., 2017; Gray, 2006; Guthrie et al., 2017; Rinaldi et al., 2018 ). Investigating corporate reporting processes helps ensure corporate sustainability, transparency, accountability, and stakeholder engagement (Aras & Crowther, 2009; Bebbington & Thy, 1999; La Torre et al., 2018; Stubbs & Higgins, 2018; Stubbs et al., 2013 ). Analyzed as stakeholder-driven phenomena (Jerónimo et al., 2020; Lee & Raschke, 2020 ), these factors are crucial to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development since they allow stakeholders’ more responsible and aware commitment (Walsh et al., 2020 ). Social media's disruptive and transformative potential for accounting, accountants, and accountability has been recognized recently in the literature. Analyzing the impact of technology and disruption in accounting research, Marrone and Hazelton (2019)  highlight that academic accounting articles featuring “disruption” are rarely linked with “technology”. The concept of “disruption” has been broadly synonymous with crises having predominantly social or environmental causes (e.g., natural disasters). The literature on technology has coalesced around three broad themes – creation, deployment, and protection – which have not been identified as crisis triggers. So, the most commonly used digital technologies for accounting are social media, enhanced data visualization, and blockchain (Hollebeek et al., 2014; Marrone & Hazelton, 2019; Ramos & Casado-Molina, 2021 ). In such a context, however, mechanisms must be established to reduce the lack of data since corporate sustainability practices differ widely and represent a voluntary initiative by corporations, so they are not disclosed in the standard corporate reporting (Pranugrahaning et al., 2021 ). By publishing extensive and complex reports with disparate data and information on corporate sustainability, firms often fail to derive marketing benefits from social investment and their sustainable strategy (La Torre et al., 2018 ). The lack of factual data impedes the research on corporate sustainability practices and their contribution to sustainable development (Al Hawaj & Buallay, 2021 ). International comparisons are unavailable, and corporate sustainability practices are characterized by low efficiency without scientific support (Rego et al., 2017 ). On the other hand, firms’ full achievement of SDGs in the digital landscape requires collaboration and stakeholder involvement (Söderholm et al., 2019 ). In light of the above context, we argue that stakeholders’ sentiment towards a firm’s digital footprint can influence its (financial and non-financial) performance. As for our knowledge, the above relationship has been often overlooked. Therefore, this study aims to fill the gap regarding two main contemporary trends, which guide the research questions surrounding this study: (i) the impact of digital reputation on a firm’s financial and non-financial performance; and (ii) the conditions under which a firm’s orientation towards sustainable development can moderate this relationship. In more detail, we expect that firms with a stronger digital reputation reveal a higher performance. Moreover, the above relationship will be even higher for those firms able to show their orientation towards non-financial information. Qualitative and quantitative analyses have been employed on a sample of firms from the Fortune 500 list from 2015 to 2019. Firstly, we developed a dedicated vocabulary to evaluate firms' commitment to the SDGs. Then, a content analysis was carried out on firms’ non-financial reports to operationalize the effectiveness of the non-financial information through three measures of firms’ orientation towards SDG-related themes: depth, defined as the total volume of the SDG-based information covered by a firm; breadth, representing the variety of SDG-related themes covered by a firm; and concentration, which is the distribution of non-financial information among the SDGs. Secondly, a longitudinal quantitative analysis was run through panel regression models to test the moderating effect of a firm’s effective orientation towards sustainable development. The findings show that digital reputation positively impacts a firm’s financial and non-financial performance. Furthermore, the results reveal that breadth and concentration operate as moderators in the above relationship. On the other hand, depth appears not to be significant. This study enriches the debate by providing a new data operationalization process to measure a firm’s commitment towards the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda. The SDG vocabulary allows the creation of a common and shared language to understand what companies are doing in terms of digital innovation for sustainable development. Furthermore, the effectiveness of non-financial information measures shows the full integration of sustainability issues in the firm strategy, which means that soft information (e.g., firms' SDG orientation) in the non-financial reports is effective. Additionally, the paper aims to identify lessons learned and research gaps to provide an agenda for future research. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2  presents the literature review and hypothesis development. Section 3  presents the methodological approach. Section 4  outlines the results. Finally, section 5 provides a discussion and conclusions and a future agenda.  2 Literature review and hypothesis development 2.1 Digital reputation and firm performance Digitalization, and the more extensive diffusion of digital technologies (Nambisan et al., 2017 ), such as social media, big data analytics, and cloud computing, is opening up fascinating disruptions in the theory and practice of accounting, accountants, and accountability by impacting on accounting professions and processes (Marrone & Hazelton, 2019 ). One of the main advantages associated with the process of digitalization is the growing relevance of real-time corporate reporting of firms’ performance, for both internal and external purposes (Gepp et al., 2018 ), as well as the management of a firm’s reputation in the digital context (Efimova & Rozhnova, 2018; Rink, 2020 ). In this context, social media technologies such as Twitter disclose new opportunities for both mandatory and voluntary disclosure (Ramassa & Di Fabio, 2016 ). However, mandatory disclosure is influenced by regulations and country-based legislation with limited margins for action (Arena et al., 2018; Bagnoli & Watts, 2007 ). While in the voluntary disclosure framework, digitalization could enhance the challenges of more transparent information communication for the stakeholders (Bebbington & Thy, 1999; Larrinaga et al., 2002; Zhang, 2012 ). It is due to the contribution that digital technologies can offer to the promotion of more effective corporate communication since they can work as facilitators of financial and non-financial information and disclosure activities for stakeholders (Crock et al., 2018; Gepp et al., 2018; Marrone & Hazelton, 2019; Ramassa & Di Fabio, 2016 ). Social media has assumed  specific relevance in this context, mainly through social networks such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter (Secundo et al., 2020 ).  Social media tools have a prominent role within society; they represent a subset of technologies, “computer-mediated tools that make it possible for anyone to create, circulate, share, and exchange information in a variety of formats and with multiple communities” (Leonardi & Vaast, 2017, p. 150 ). Specifically, such technologies have been demonstrated to be suitable tools for spreading information to stakeholders (Ramassa & Di Fabio, 2016 ); for providing, updating, and creating commitment to the corporate facts and advancement; and for supporting the process of corporate reporting and disclosure to stakeholders (Mukhomorova et al., 2019; Ndou et al., 2018 ). Although the authors show that social media are used without fully exploiting their potential, regulators and investor organizations are adopting social media to disclose financial information. Ramassa and Di Fabio (2016)  provide a background for future accounting studies by presenting the new firm communication paradigm based on financial information using social media. Among the other relevant digital technologies, big data and their analytics disclose several opportunities for the management in real-time corporate reporting (Gepp et al., 2018; Ramassa & Di Fabio, 2016 ). In this perspective, we argue that the contribution of big data to corporate reporting can be synthesized in terms of enabling digital tools for corporate information and decision-making, stakeholders' engagement and sustainable practices, earnings management, accountability, and transparent communication. Therefore, we suggest further investigation of this issue, mainly concerning digitalization for corporate reporting. Integrating mandatory and voluntary reporting aims to enhance the organization's credibility and support the creation of a reliable company's digital brand reputation for stakeholders (Bartikowski & Walsh, 2011 ). However, the diffusion of the above-mentioned digital technologies and social media has exposed the companies' reputation and brand images to a turbulent digital arena. This challenging profile of the phenomenon is supported by several studies in different domains that focus on comprehending the features and dynamics supporting an effective process of digital reputation management (Meek et al., 2019; Rink, 2020 ). In a study on the development of corporate reporting in the digital era, Efimova and Rozhnova (2018)  analyzed how big data impact financial reporting by making it more effective, with increasing transparency for investors and stakeholders. The authors suggest some routes for future investigation by highlighting the need for a deeper comprehension of what digital technologies can mean for reputation management in the digital space. In other recent studies, the issue of digital corporate sustainability has been explored regarding firms' performances resulting from a digital marketing strategy (Naoumova & Katrichis, 2021 ), the dissemination of information on the website in banking (Schröder, 2021 ), the setting of a corporate sustainability strategy in the context of the sharing economy (Etter et al., 2019 ), and the enhancement of stakeholders’ commitment and e-reputation (Dutot et al., 2016 ). The accessibility represents a further critical perspective highlighted by the digitalization of non-financial information. In this perspective, a recent study published by Gazzola et al. (2020)  demonstrated the positive trend related to the accessibility of non-financial documents resulting from the more extensive adoption of websites and digital solutions for disclosure and communication. Furthermore, these trends assume challenging dimensions in the countries according to their development and market sophistication (Popkova et al., 2021 ). Despite the broader adoption of digital technologies in accounting, a complete comprehension of the meaning and applications is far from consolidated and calls for further investigation, mainly in terms of the implications of a digital reputation—herein defined as the set of stakeholders' sentiments towards the company's digital footprint (i.e., digital self-representation on digital media)—for the firm’s financial and non-financial performance. Thus, we propose the first set of hypotheses. H1. There is a positive relationship between digital reputation and firm performance. In particular: H1a. There is a positive relationship between digital reputation and firms’ financial performance. H1b. There is a positive relationship between digital reputation and firms’ non-financial performance.  2.2 The moderating role of the firm's orientation towards SDG-related themes Within the above context, financial reports have become integrated reports, including the non-financial information (e.g., sustainability, health safety, corruption, environment) required by accounting legislation across countries (Holgaard & Jørgensen, 2005; Tschopp & Huefner, 2015 ). Indeed, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification became the single official source of authoritative, non-governmental United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, companies' greater transparency regarding their financial and non-financial performance, which often refers to information about sustainability, society, and the environment, needs to be adapted to the specific country’s legislation (La Torre et al., 2018 ). According to Tarquinio and Posadas (2020) , non-financial information is generally considered non-accounting information (e.g., Environmental, Social, and Governance [ESG] information), even though it is managed as complementary to financial information. In addition, corporations’ disclosure of non-financial information has been entrusted to different reports (e.g., sustainability reporting, environmental reporting, intellectual capital reporting, and integrated global reporting). The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) represents the most popular sustainability reporting framework worldwide (KPMG, 2017 ). The GRI was founded as a multi-stakeholder process in 1997 by the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES) to develop globally applicable sustainability reporting guidelines for business and governmental and non-governmental organizations (Initiative, 2011 ). The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) was also involved in setting up the GRI. Their guidelines also offer a unilateral standard for non-financial reporting, which can be voluntarily used by the issuers of the respective reports (Hahn & Kühnen, 2013 ). Many business entities worldwide adopt the GRI guidelines explicitly in preparing their sustainability reports; therefore, the increasing trend for sustainability reporting has been attributed to the development of the GRI. Despite this, from a practical perspective, the research results address the criticism related to the legislations and guidelines of each country in effectively helping the firm enhance accountability (Masiero et al., 2019 ). On the one hand, several stakeholders (e.g., shareholders, institutional investors, and customers) consider non-financial information relevant to evaluating the firm's long-term ability to survive and succeed (Arvidsson, 2011; Flöstrand & Ström, 2006; Robb & Zarzeski, 2001; Shevlin, 1996 ). Indeed, the growing adoption of voluntary corporate accounts can be seen as an expression of the symbiotic transformation of conventional accounting, “which has focused upon ways of extending current practices and/or deriving new forms of reporting and accounting” (Gray et al., 2014, p. 260 ). This accounting transformation aims to detect and report non-financial valuable information for “identifying sustainability risks and increasing investor and consumer trust” (Commission, 2011 ). On the other hand, the sustainability report highlights ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) elements using stakeholders’ needs (Stubbs & Higgins, 2018 ). Lodhia and Sharma (2019, p. 309)  argue that “sustainability accounting and reporting has become one of the major issues that firms grapple with daily.” Finally, Ramassa & Di Fabio (2016)  highlight the role of new and smart technologies (e.g., big data, social media, XBRL) in promoting corporate communication. Therefore, corporate reporting practices and processes based on digital and smart technologies are facilitators of the financial and non-financial information disclosed to stakeholders (Crock et al., 2018; Gepp et al., 2018 ; Marrone & Hazelton, 2019a; Ramassa & Di Fabio, 2016 ). Therefore, it is a promising and novel research stream to foster corporate reports in accounting studies. The launch of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the United Nations in 2015 represented a further acceleration of the practice associated with non-financial disclosure and reporting (Pizzi et al., 2021 ). In addition, the implications of the SDGs have also been central to corporate sustainability reporting (Pillai et al., 2017; Poddar et al., 2019; Tsalis et al., 2020 ). In this direction, the USA’s GAAP and related national legislations have defined a set of information that needs to be included in non-financial reporting, supporting the development of major awareness of the meaning and implications of sustainable patterns in coherence with sustainability standards (Gazzola et al., 2020 ). Despite the broader meaning of sustainability resulting from the SDGs, specific issues impacting non-financial reporting have been identified in terms of environmental responsibility, for example, suggesting the need to improve firms’ voluntary disclosure in terms of establishing a well-structured environmental strategy and related measurable outcomes (Balluchi et al., 2021 ). All this suggests the need to rethink firms' strategies and the management of non-financial reporting and disclosure to address firms' orientation and actions towards achieving SDGs and related themes. Despite the great interest in this topic, a complete comprehension of the implications and meaning of the SDGs for non-financial reporting and disclosure is still lacking. Several areas for further study can be identified regarding managerial practice and policymakers' agenda. Therefore, we argue that firms have a different orientation towards SDG-related themes depending on different factors, both endogenous (e.g., strategic corporate values, resource dependence) and exogenous (e.g., stakeholder needs, competitive pressures). Such different orientations might also influence the (positive) relationship between the digital reputation of the firm and its performance. Thus, we propose a second set of hypotheses. H2: The orientation towards non-financial information positively moderates the relationship between digital reputation and firm performance. In particular: H2a. The tendency of the firm to focus on specific SDG-related themes has a positive impact on the relationship between digital reputation and firms’ financial (non-financial) performance. H2b: The firm's tendency to cover a wider variety of SDG-related themes has a positive impact on the relationship between digital reputation and firms’ financial (non-financial) performance. H2c: The tendency of the firm to balance attention towards different SDGs has a positive impact on the relationship between digital reputation and firms’ financial (non-financial) performance. The research design shown in Fig. 1   summarizes the new lines developed in this study.   3 Methodology 3.1 Research Setting, data Collection, and empirical strategy The target population for the study is companies listed in the Fortune 500 in 2018. These firms are the largest companies in the United States based on their total annual turnover. We chose our sample for several reasons. Firstly, several studies have examined these firms to investigate corporate sustainability behaviors (Direction, 2020; Kurt, 2019 ) and the related impact on performance (Singh et al., 2020 ). Secondly, we are in the midst of a corporate technological transformation, and the Fortune 500 sample is famous for being technological and innovative companies (Wang et al., 2011 ), pioneering the role of the Chief Digitalization Officer or Chief Information Officer (Neely et al., 2020 ). Thus, in line with our research objectives, the Fortune 500 is suitable for the investigation. The data collection followed a strict analysis protocol. Firstly, the Fortune 500 documented in 2018 was optimized by the Fortune 500 official website. Subsequently, non-financial reports were collected through online collections and the firms’ websites. The non-financial report is a kind of voluntary reporting by which companies formally disclose information related to their social and environmental commitments. Accordingly, they are reasonable instruments for investigating stakeholders’ engagement to communicate a sustainability strategy (Vurro & Perrini, 2011 ) and are strategic tools for operationalizing depth, breadth, and concentration.  Data collection pertains to the period 2015–2019. Therefore, it covers the entire availability period of the companies' non-financial reports, which were first available in 2015. In addition, all companies that publish a non-financial report must have published the report for 2019, while at the time the research began, there were insufficient non-financial reports dating from 2020 for the analyses to be valid. Furthermore, the main data valid for digital reputation have been available since 2015. Subsequently, economic, financial, and sustainable data were collected from Thomson Reuters' Eikon database, while the Bloomberg database was used to obtain digital reputation data. Finally, the sampling strategy allowed us to optimize a final sample of 476 firms and approximately 2,300 non-financial reports. To operationalize the study’s moderating variables—i.e.,  depth, breadth, and concentration—a meta -analysis was developed to examine the language, vocabulary, and expressions used to explain sustainable development. The search strategy selected the specific keywords used by the United Nations to define each of the 17 SDGs and the related 169 targets. This step is relevant for the empirical strategy of the study, as it has made the object of the research more explicit. According to the main qualitative research studies (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004; Kyngäs & Vanhanen, 1999; Oliver, 2010; Polit & Beck, 2004 ), for the validity of the qualitative content analysis, it is desirable to use appendices and tables to demonstrate the links between data and results (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004 ). With this intent, we provide the vocabulary of sustainable development goals in the Appendix, with 155 words (Grover et al., 2019 ) that allow correspondence between the concepts and the data (Krippendorff, 2018 ). Subsequently, content analysis of the non-financial reports was performed. The use of content analysis in economics studies is growing (Oliveira et al., 2013 ) due to the ability to detect stable and replicable data (Krippendorff & Campelli, 1983 ). Content analysis was used to analyze the expressions applied in the non-financial reports to identify the firms' orientation towards sustainable development. The volume of data for this kind of research is typically large, and data collection tools may help streamline the analysis process. MAXQDA 2020 software was used for this study, which offers valuable data management and analysis support. The process was performed for the firms' non-financial reports between 2015 and 2019. The results obtained from this analysis were used to operationalize the effectiveness of non-financial information.  3.2 Measures 3.2.1 Dependent variable: Firm performance Financial performance was calculated using market capitalization. Thomason Reuters measure this variable as the end market price multiplied by the ordinary shares outstanding at the end market price, representing the closing price of the company's shares on 31 December for each year in the analysis period. In addition, we used Thomson Reuters' ASSET4 database to operationalize non-financial performance. Thomson Reuters' non-financial performance measures are counted as an overall firm score based on the information reported in the environmental, social, and corporate governance pillars (Drempetic et al., 2019 ).  3.2.2 Independent variable: Digital reputation Bloomberg uses machine-learning techniques to identify a news story or tweet as significant for a firm and assign a sentiment score to each. Then, all tweets with sentiment scores are aggregated using a proprietary method producing a firm-level sentiment score. For this study, the sentiment data for each firm in the sample are collected yearly. The variable ranges from −1 (most negative) to 1 (most positive).  3.2.3 Moderator variable: Effectiveness of non-financial information The effectiveness of non-financial information was formulated based on the previous literature. In particular, Vurro and Perrini (2011)  suggested a disclosure depth and breadth index to quantify the disclosure of integrated reporting in terms of stakeholders. Moreover, Romito and Vurro (2021)  analyze the structure of non-financial disclosure along with depth, breadth, and concentration dimensions. We revised the depth measurement of the effectiveness of non-financial information, which clearly represents the total volume of SDG-based information disclosed yearly by each firm in the sample through a non-financial report. To operationalize the variable, we summed the number of sentences referring to each disclosure category related to SDGs j  disclosed by firm i  in year t . Analytically, we adopted the following formula to compute the index:Depth  it   = ∑ j = 1  m  S D G  jit   ∑ i = 1  n  SDG  jit    ∑ j = 1  m  ∑ i  n  SDG  jit          where SDG  jit      represents the number of sentences relative to SDGs j  issued by firm i  in year t ; m  is the number of SDGs; n  is the number of firms included in the sample. Therefore, depth ranges from 0 to 6.237. Breadth accounts for various SDG-related themes covered by each firm in its non-financial reports. To operationalize the variable, we divided the number of themes covered by the number of themes related to that SDG for each SDG. The following formula was used:Breadth  it   = ∑ j = 1  m  ∑ i = 1  n  SDG  itj    ∑ i = 1  k  SDG  i           where ∑ i = 1  n  SDG  itj      is the total number of SDG keywords reported by firm i  for each SDG j  at time t , and ∑ i = 1  k  SDG  i     is the total number of SDG keywords for all SGDs i . Therefore, breadth ranges from 0 to 6.805. Finally, concentration reflects how the non-financial disclosure released by each firm is distributed across themes and, consequently, SDGs. It reflects how much a firm balances its attention toward different SDGs. Following Pfarrer et al. (2008), we used the Gini coefficient to operationalize equality/inequality in each firm's salience of the different SDGs. In particular, we implemented the following formula:Concentration  it   = 1 + 1 m  - 2 m  2  y  ¯       ( y 1  + 2 y  2  + ⋯ + my  m  )       where the expression ( y 1  +  2 y  2  + ⋯ + my  m  )    is the sequence of disclosure levels for each SDG in decreasing order of size for each firm in year t ; y  is the overall average effectiveness level for each firm in year t ; m  is the total number of SDGs. Therefore, the concentration ranges from 0 to 0.886.  3.2.4 Control variable Consistent with prior studies, several economic and environmental variables were included to account for potential heterogeneity. All the control data were collected from Thomson Reuters. Thus, firm size was measured as the natural logarithm of the total assets (Braam & Peeters, 2018 ). Financial pressure was controlled using leverage, calculated as net debt divided by total equity (Simnett et al., 2009 ). The company's profitability is its ability to repay its capital, controlled by the return on equity. Environmental effect is controlled using the CSR reporting score and indicates the communication skills of companies that conduct corporate and social responsibility in everyday practices. Finally, the industry effect using double-digit US Standard Industrial Classification codes (Simoni et al., 2020 ) was used to control the sector (dummy sector). Since this dummy variable is not statistically significant, it is not shown in the resulting table, thus facilitating the analysis of the rest of the information.   3.3 Estimation procedures The analysis was performed using the hierarchical regression estimation model. Statistical regressions were performed on the panel data to test H1 (and the related H1a and H1b). Panel data have many benefits, including making reliable inferences, clarifying the phenomenon's complexity, and monitoring missing variables' effects. The Breusch-Pagan Lagrange multiplier and the Hausman test were performed, indicating the fixed effects model as the best choice for the analyses. Furthermore, tests for multicollinearity showed that the simulations' maximum variance inflation factor index did not exceed the crucial quantity of 10 (Kleinbaum et al., 1998 ). Subsequently, to test H2 (and the related H2a, H2b, and H2c), a proper iteration term was created for each hypothesis to test the effect of moderation on the effectiveness of non-financial information. Each model's dependent and independent variables were delayed by one year. Finally, the regression model was expressed as follows:F i n a n c i a l N o n - f i n a n c i a l   p e r f o r m a n c e  t + 1   = α + β 1  D i g i t a l  R e u t a t i o n + β 2  S i z e + β 3  L e v e r a g e + β 4  E d i t  M a r g i n + β 4  R & D + β 5  C S R  R e p o r t i n g + β 6  S t a k e h o l d e r  E n g a g e m e n t + β 5  D u m m y  S e c t o r + β 5  D u m m y  Y e a r + ε      The moderated model was expressed as follows:F i n a n c i a l N o n - f i n a n c i a l    p e r f o r m a n c e  t + 1   = α + β 1  I n t e r a c t i o n  t e r m + β 2  D i g i t a l  R e u t a t i o n + β 3  E f f e c t i v e n e s s  o f  n o n  f i n a n c i a l  d a t a + β 4   S i z e + β 5  L e v e r a g e + β 6  E d i t  M a r g i n + β 7  R & D + β 8  C S R  R e p o r t i n g + β 9  S t a k e h o l d e r  E n g a g e m e n t + β 10  D u m m y  S e c t o r + β 11  D u m m y  Y e a r + ε        4 Results 4.1 Result of hypothesis tests Table 1   presents descriptive statistics and the correlation matrix. The dependent variables are correlated with almost all variables. Table 2   shows the results for all hypotheses. In detail, Table 2  includes different models following the hierarchical procedure presented above: first a model with the control variables (Model CV); then Model 1, presenting the impact of digital reputation on financial (above) and non-financial (under) performance; then the models with the moderation effects depth (Model 2), breadth (Model 3) and concentration (Model 4) are presented in sequence. Hypothesis 1 suggested a positive relationship between digital reputation and firms’ financial (H1a) and non-financial (H1b) performance. The results (Model 1) show that digital reputation is positively and significantly related to both financial (β = 0.644, p < 0.01) and non-financial (β = 28.336, p < 0.01) performance. Therefore, H1a and H1b are supported. Table 2  shows the results of the hypothesized moderation in the second set of hypotheses. Hypothesis 2 suggested that depth (H2a), breadth (H2b), and concentration (H2c), which are the measures of the effectiveness of non-financial performance, moderated the relationship between digital reputation and firms’ performance. Model 2 indicates that the interaction term between depth and digital reputation is negative and not significantly correlated with financial performance (β = -0.001), and positive and not significantly correlated with non-financial performance (β = 0.136). Therefore, H2a is not supported. In the Model 3, the interaction term between breadth and digital reputation is positive and significantly correlated with both financial performance (β = 0.116; p < 0.1) and non-financial performance (β = 7.181; p < 0.05). Thus, H2b is supported. Finally, in Model 4, the interaction term between concentration and digital reputation, is positive and significantly correlated with both financial performance (β = 0.798; p < 0.1), and non-financial performance (β = 34.448; p < 0.05). Consequently, H2c is supported. Though the analysis confirms the moderation hypothesis (H2b and H2c), it would be desirable to conduct an effect size test. Comparing the effect-size values for the moderation models with the values of Cohen (2013) and Aguinis et al. (2005) , low moderation occurs with the breadth and high moderation with concentration for both financial and non-financial performance.   5 Discussion and conclusion This study aims to understand better two mainstream topics, digitalization and the firm's orientation towards SDG themes. Specifically, we investigate the impact of firms’ digital reputation—defined as the stakeholder sentiment towards the company's digital footprint—on firms' financial and non-financial performance. Furthermore, we show the conditions under which a firm’s orientation towards sustainable development—measured as depth, breadth, and concentration—moderates the relationship between digital reputation and firm performance. Firstly, the results show that digital reputation positively impacts a firm's financial and non-financial performance. In other words, the company's orientation towards digital technologies must be focused on the digital footprint—that is, the digital self-representation on social media (Bartikowski & Walsh, 2011; Efimova & Rozhnova, 2018; Rink, 2020 ). In fact, by communicating with stakeholders through digital platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn), the firm understands the stakeholder sentiment and consequently improves its performance. Specifically, the company's involvement in social media makes it possible to gain advantages in both financial and non-financial outcomes. This outcome is in line and coherent with the work of Ramos and Casado-Molina (2021) , according to which corporate reputation is defined by the relationship between emotions, experiences, and attitudes that affect tangible assets and, consequently, are correlated with the business value of the corporation. Secondly, regarding the firm's orientation towards SDG themes, our insights reveal that the effectiveness of data, operationalized as breadth (the variety of SDG-related themes covered) and concentration (the distribution of non-financial disclosure among the SDGs), operates as a moderator in the above relationship. On the other hand, depth (defined as the total volume of the SDG-based information) appears not to be significant. Thus, in terms of strategies to improve the firm’s financial and non-financial performance, the variety of SDG-related themes covered (breadth) and the distribution of non-financial disclosure among the SDGs (concentration) appear to be determining factors for improving the effectiveness of digital reputation for the performance of the company. Nevertheless, the total volume of the SDG-based information is not crucial in the explored relationship. Our results confirm that investing in a digital platform is beneficial because companies can gain financial and non-financial performance benefits. In addition, strategic integration of the SDG issues - understood as breadth and concentration - represents the condition under which the company increases the benefits of developing its digital footprint. Firms frequently fail to reap marketing value from social investment by producing large and complicated non-financial reports containing different sustainable information (La Torre et al., 2018 ). This phenomenon reduces the value of corporate sustainability efforts, making them confusing and ambiguous to customers. Moreover, with the introduction and rising use of digital social media, firms have the opportunity to interact with their stakeholders directly (Crock et al., 2018; Gepp et al., 2018; Marrone & Hazelton, 2019; Ramassa & Di Fabio, 2016 ). Therefore, it implies creating a specific digital reputation to deliver the appropriate type of communication to interact with stakeholders. However, the relevant literature does not clearly define the relationship between these concepts and how digital reputation and firms' SDGs-orientation affect the performance of organizations. Therefore, we offered an original conceptual framework that involves digital reputation as the underlying determinant of corporate financial and non-financial performance. Moreover, we posit that the orientation towards non-financial information is crucial in moderating the relationship between digital reputation and firms' performance. Due to a lack of actual data, research on corporate social responsibility activities and their contribution to sustainable development is hampered (Ferreira et al., 2021 ). Without scientific support, international comparisons are unattainable, and corporate social responsibility practices are characterized by low efficiency. This research aims to solve the issue by systematizing accessible data related to the SDGs, providing information support, and conducting scientific research on sustainable development. Given this, the study enriches the debate by providing a new data operationalization process to measure the firm's commitment towards the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda. The SDG vocabulary enables establishing a single and shared language for understanding businesses' actions to promote sustainable development. Furthermore, the usefulness of non-financial information demonstrates the full integration of sustainability concerns for firms' business strategy, implying that non-financial reports' soft information (e.g., SDG business, SDG orientation) is acceptable. The issue of sustainable development is well-covered in the extant research literature (Arvidsson, 2011; Flöstrand & Ström, 2006; Robb & Zarzeski, 2001; Shevlin, 1996 ), although only in one respect: from the viewpoint of worldwide community support of SDGs and state support, implementation and regulation. For this reason, we have developed research focusing on firms' contribution to sustainable development. The sample of listed Fortune 500 firms proved to be a suitable foundation for the investigation to support the firms' contribution to improving sustainable development. Besides its theoretical contributions, this study also reveals practical and social implications related to the role of digital reputation and related sustainable strategies. Firstly, from the professional's point of view, this study confirms that firms embarking on a digitalization process can reap benefits in terms of improved performance. From a stakeholder engagement perspective, the news communicated through digital platforms influences the market response to such information. In particular, firms should manage their digital reputation to generate value for their stakeholders and increase firms financial and non-financial performance. Therefore, we suggest that firms that invest in digitization processes should consider promoting and improving the company's digital footprint. Secondly, non-financial reporting helps companies to be increasingly transparent. This kind of reporting is a tool that describes the firm's economic, social and environmental dimensions. Since breadth and concentration are the main underlying determinants of better financial and non-financial performance, this research suggests that firms should focus on the quality (in terms of breadth and concentration) of non-financial information rather than the quantity (in terms of data depth). Specifically, the breadth of the topics relating to the SDGs in the reports amplifies the effect of digital reputation on firms' performance. Thus, companies that are consistent in distributing information across the SDGs benefit from increased information quality. Finally, by following the quality criteria of the non-financial information, companies ensure that the information reported in the non-financial reports is sufficient and understood effortlessly by stakeholders. Thirdly, from the perspective of sustainable development strategy, firms should adopt the tools established by the UN 2030 Agenda to standardize non-financial reporting and, above all, use them to reduce information asymmetries in the dialogue between companies and stakeholders. In this way, companies that accomplish the SDG guidelines will have an easier way for communicating their sustainability strategies to the market. However, on the other hand, the market will rely on this type of communication.  6 Limitations and avenues for future research Our paper opens potentially new grounds for appreciating the role of non-financial information in influencing the effectiveness of firms' orientation towards sustainable development. Nevertheless, this study has limitations that could be explored in future research. Firstly, our study focused on a sample of large Fortune 500 firms: future research may investigate the dynamics of digital reputation in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Due to how firms manage digital transformation, we can expect different results from the relationship between digital reputation and firm performance. Secondly, we considered the Thomson Reuters Asset4 database's non-financial performance metric. This metric represents the aggregate value of corporate social and environmental performance: future research could look into the disaggregated indicators. Moreover, we test the impact of digital reputation on financial and non-financial performance. We suggest that future research can apply a holistic approach to observe how different dependent variables are influenced by digital reputation in all aspects of firms’ performance. Finally, regarding the operationalization of digital reputation, the variable extracted from Thomson Reuters Asset4 was used. Further research could expand the target of the digital platform in which the company engages stakeholders, considering other digital media platforms. It is hoped that this research will inspire both theoretical and empirical studies in digitization and sustainable development.
