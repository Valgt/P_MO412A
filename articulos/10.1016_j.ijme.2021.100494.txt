                  This research contributes to the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through Education, a growing area of research, by means of a systematic review of the literature on Education and SDGs. A total of 160 articles published over the past 10 years were obtained and compared. This made it possible to identify the top contributing and most influential authors, countries, papers and research findings, together with the challenges facing current research.
                  Based on these results, this work provides a thorough insight into the field by (1) proposing six research categories and their future research directions, and (2) proposing a framework to guide academic institutions in the integration of SDGs in their activity. The framework makes it possible to incorporate the vision of the different stakeholders that constitute the learning community in order to generate a global strategy for continuous improvement, to implement it through action plans, and to measure and evaluate the results.

This research contributes to the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through Education, a growing area of research, by means of a systematic review of the literature on Education and SDGs. A total of 160 articles published over the past 10 years were obtained and compared. This made it possible to identify the top contributing and most influential authors, countries, papers and research findings, together with the challenges facing current research. Based on these results, this work provides a thorough insight into the field by (1) proposing six research categories and their future research directions, and (2) proposing a framework to guide academic institutions in the integration of SDGs in their activity. The framework makes it possible to incorporate the vision of the different stakeholders that constitute the learning community in order to generate a global strategy for continuous improvement, to implement it through action plans, and to measure and evaluate the results.   Keywords Sustainability  Sustainable development goals  Education for sustainable development  Stakeholders    1 Introduction Sustainability has undoubtedly been one of the key themes since the beginning of the Anthropocene (Crutzen, 2006 ). This historical period is characterized by the appearance of numerous advances that allow the quality of life to be improved, while society reflects on its actions and is self-critical (Beck, Giddens and Lash, 1997 ). The interconnections between humanity and the environment are beginning to become evident, and how the results of the actions carried out by humans may put their very survival in the future in doubt (Meadows et al., 1972 ). Humanity is beginning to become aware of the limits of the planet and the unsustainability of its development, which has led to the current worldwide state of emergency (Bybee, 1991 ). Individual and collective decisions are closely related to the possibility of improving humanity's relationship with the planet. Therefore, a shift of consciousness in favour of values, attitudes and behaviours that enable the necessary conditions for change is an absolute must (Fien, 1995 ; Murga-Menoyo, 2015 ; Rieckmann, 2017 ). The United Nations Organization (UN) is aware of the importance of a collective awareness, and since the 1990s it has highlighted the significant role that education plays in the transition towards the new model of sustainable development. Education contributes to sustainability in two ways. On the one hand, fostering in people of all ages awareness, knowledge, attitudes, values, skills and actions to ensure environmental protection and conservation. On the other hand, encouraging economic sustainability and promoting social equity and inclusion through the development of productive skills to improve and maintain prosperity and competence, the development of civic skills to allow for meaningful participation in civil society and political life, and the development of human talents and interests which allow the advance of the human knowledge (Bolstad, 2003 ; Nevin, 2008 ; UNESCO, 2014a ). To this end, UN established Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) as the main engine driving change, and has carried out different institutional initiatives related with it since then, such as the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005–2014), or the UN Global Action Programme on ESD (2014). With the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, the UN reiterates the importance of ESD by establishing the SDGs4 Quality Education , the seventh goal of which (4.7) mentions ESD: “By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture's contribution to sustainable development ”. In turn, Education for Sustainable Development is a catalyst for achieving the SDGs. As Quian Tang, UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Education, states in the foreword of the publication “Education for the SDGs” when talking about the double meaning of SDG 4: on the one hand, education is a goal in itself and, on the other hand, it is an instrument of social transformation necessary for the achievement of the rest of the global objectives, through the acquisition of skills, attitudes and behaviours that guide towards a sustainable future. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new educational model that, through ESD, integrates the SDGs in learning (Rieckmann, 2017 ). This new educational model based on use education for the SDGs achievement generates a challenge in education management because it is necessary to reorient curriculum, programs, practices, and policies. This challenge affects the governance of education, educational institutions managers and educators, as well as the content and pedagogy of education. The implementation of this new educational model in real cases of educational institutions is still limited, and hence practitioners (legislators, educational institutions managers, curriculum developers, educators or trainers from formal and informal education, etc.) have problems concerning how to use Education to promote the SDGs in educational institutions (Leal Filho et al., 2019 ). Main barriers to this include lack of awareness or knowledge about the principles of sustainable development, lack of senior management support, resistance to change, in some disciplines sustainability development is seen as irrelevant, perceived threats to academic integrity or freedom, lack of resources such as information, time or funding, and an overcrowded curriculum (Verhulst & Lambrechts, 2015 ). This could limit its dissemination, since existing literature in the field of ESD do not consider the Integration and impact of the ESD in educational institutions management. Therefore, further research on these issues is required. In order to fill the research gap between the growing interest in use Education to promote the SDGs and how it can be integrated in educational institutions, this paper has a double objective: (1) to contextualize the state of the art by means of exploring the status of research in the domain of Education and SDGs, as well as of establishing research categories that bring together research conducted on the basis of relevant common points, and (2) to use the insights of this literature review to propose a framework to support educational institutions in integrating Education for the SDGs in these organizations. In particular, the following research questions (RQs) are posed: RQ1: Which are the top contributing authors, countries, and institutions in the field of Integration of the SDGs in Education? RQ2: Is it possible to define research categories on the basis of relevant common points? RQ3: What are the future research necessities in the field of Integration of the SDGs in Education? RQ4: Is it possible to develop a framework that allows Educational Institutions to integrate the SDGs in Education? To answer the above research questions, and to address Education as a means to support the SDGs, this paper (1) carries out a systematic review of the literature on Education and SDGs published since 2015 (year of publication of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs) until the end of 2020, since it is an efficient research method that allows a precise evaluation of the information published to date (Manterola et al., 2013 ); (2) provides a thorough insight into the field by using bibliometric analysis techniques to evaluate 160 articles published over the past 5 years, and to identify top contributing authors, countries and key research topics related to the field; (3) obtains and compares the most influential works based on citations; (4) identifies and proposes six established and emerging research categories that would encourage scholars to expand research on Integration of the SDGs in Education; (5) identifies the future research necessities in every research category; and (6) proposes a framework to support education Educational Institutions to integrate SDG in Education. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2  presents a review of the literature related to Education for SDG. Section 3  describes the software tools and the research methodology used to perform the bibliographical analyses. Section 4  offers the findings of the bibliographical analyses. Section 5  shows the framework to support Educational Institutions to Integrate SGDs in Education. Finally, section 6  discusses the findings, and section 7  shows the conclusions, research limitations and future work.  2 Institutional Background 2.1 The 2030 agenda and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals Almost 30 years after the report Our Future in Common (Brundtland et al., 1987 ), which analysed, criticized and reconsidered the policies of globalized economic development, and recognized that social advances were being carried out at a high environmental cost, humanity now has a global roadmap to achieve sustainable development: the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Table 1  ). The SDGs were defined by the UN at the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development in September 2015, and are included in the document Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN, 2015), which contains 17 goals and 169 targets. The goals address global challenges crucial to the survival of humanity; set environmental limits and critical thresholds for the use of natural resources; and recognize that the eradication of poverty must go hand in hand with strategies that promote economic development (UNESCO, 2017 ). They are applied in the following areas: education, health, social protection and job opportunities, climate change and environmental protection. Their objectives are not independent, but are interrelated and represent the master plan to achieve a sustainable future for everyone. The 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs pose a challenge for the global community, which must come together more than ever to act globally (Robertson, 2000 ). Although SDGs are not legally binding, governments are expected to adopt them as their own and establish frameworks, policies and measures at the national level for their implementation and analysis of the degree of achievement. But the involvement of governments is not only expected, but that of everyone: the private sector, civil society and every human being. However, five years after the launching of the 2030 Agenda, and despite the progress made in the first stage of its implementation, it is not progressing with the required speed. Hence, there is an urgent need for more ambitious collective attention and action, which will make it possible to accomplish the Goals in the 2020s and achieve sustainable and inclusive development (António Guterres, 2019 ).  2.2 Education for sustainable development The need to achieve sustainable development and the fundamental role that education plays in accomplishing the SDGs have been highlighted, although as Verhulst and Lambrechts (2015)  have proved, the emphasis on the links among ESD and the promotion of every SDG differ markedly. Links between education and economic growth and employment (SDG 8), gender (SDG 5), economic equality (SDG 10), health (SDG 3), peaceful societies (SDG 16), and means of implementation (SDG 17) are the most covered. By contrast, in addition to oceans, links between education and agriculture (SDG 2), cities (SDG 11), infrastructure (SDG 9), as well as water (SDG 6) and energy (SDG 7) are little reflected. Lastly, there is relatively weak coverage of linkages between education and SDGs 12 to 15, which address sustainable consumption and production, climate change, oceans and marine resources and terrestrial ecosystems. The interest in use education as an engine driving change is reflected in the different international efforts to consolidate a type of education that allows people to have more sustainable lifestyles. Table 2   shows the different milestones that have taken place in the evolution of the concept of Education for Sustainable Development. With the aim of promoting sustainable development, ESD advocates lifelong learning that not only focuses on content and learning outcomes but also on pedagogy and learning environments that enable social transformation. ESD promotes a holistic learning process that enables the necessary conditions for learners to be able to reflect, take responsibility and carry out actions. Furthermore, ESD proposes an active role for young people, who should be the ones who participate and contribute to the process that guides societies towards a sustainable future (UNESCO, 2014b ). The relationship between SDGs and ESD is established in two ways. On the one hand, SDG 4 Quality Education identifies ESD as an educational goal (goal 4.7), since it establishes that education must enable students to make informed decisions and adopt responsible measures in favour of the integrity of the environment and the viability of the economy  (UNESCO, 2014c ). On the other hand, the SDGs must be included in education as an object of learning. ESD allows students to acquire key competencies to achieve the SDGs, such as synthetic thinking, anticipation, normative competence, strategic competence, collaborative competence, critical thinking, self-awareness and integrated problem-solving (de Haan, 2010 ; Rieckmann, 2012 ; Wiek et al., 2011 ). Although it is not the objective of this paper to analyse the SDGs, it is important to remark that there is not a common agreement about the benefits of UNESCO SDGs. Although some authors use sustainability and sustainable development as similar and interchangeable terms (Weybrecht, 2017 ), others consider them almost an oxymoronic (Kopnina, 2017 , 2020 ; Adelman, 2018 ; Bonnett, 2007 ; Kahn, 2008 ). For example, Haydn Washington (2015)  states that sustainability  refers not just to natural resources but the lives and flourishing of all beings on a finite planet, while development  typically refers to industry and economy. Other example argued by these body of criticism is that when the first two aims of the SDGs, eliminating poverty and hunger, are addressed, inclusive and sustainable economic growth is highlighted as a solution for sustainability challenges. However, continuous (and sustained in a sense of continuing to perpetuity) economic growth is likely to result in increased consumption of natural resources, thus exacerbating environmental crises. Another example state by these authors is that growth fuelled by demand for resources exacerbates environmental crises through overproduction, overconsumption, and overpopulation. The environmental crisis, in turn, is likely to affect the long-term social and economic development. The same criticism happened with Education for sustainability and Education for Sustainable Development Goals. These authors argue that UNESCO's Teaching and Learning for a Sustainable Future program essentially could stress social and economic priorities with the exclusion of eco-philosophical and strong sustainability principles.   3 Research methodology To answer RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3, scientific literature is systematically reviewed. A literature review methodology provides a systematic and reproducible design for collecting and evaluating the extant body of scholarly works on the topic studied. The results are presented in Section 4 . Considering RQ4, a framework for to support educational institutions in integrating Education for the SDGs in these organizations is conceptualized from the findings of the review and presented in Section 5 . The research methodology is broken down into four phases (Fig. 1  ): (1) definition of the research, (2) data collection, (3) analysis of results, and (4) conceptualization. Phase 1 has made it possible to explore the current links between Education and SDGs and its implementation in educational institutions in the literature in order to define the research questions and to detect possible gaps. In phase 2, a systematic review of the literature, as proposed by Rowley and Slack (2004)  and Mishra et al. (2016) , has been carried out together with an identification of research categories, following the comparative method proposed by Collier (1998) . Analysis of the findings (phase 3) has made it possible to identify the most relevant authors, countries and institutions in the field of Education and SDGs (RQ1), to identify research categories (RQ2) and to detect future research needs (RQ3). Finally, in phase 4, a Framework is proposed for the integration of SDGs in educational institutions. 3.1 Definition of the research In the definition of the research phase, we conducted a literature review to search for ideas and gaps in the Education and SDGs and its implementation in educational institutions. In particular, we were looking for frameworks, methodologies, and case studies to support managers and educators, within the ESD literature. Then, we identified a plausible gap in the research and derived the research questions to expand the understanding of the ESD implementation field.  3.2 Data collection The bibliography search was conducted using Scopus and Web of Science. These two databases are the main sources of bibliographic citations used for bibliometric analyses. This is mainly because they are the only ones that combine both a rigorous selection process and wide interdisciplinary coverage, which make them significantly stronger than the other databases (Martínez-López et al., 2018 ). There are other popular interdisciplinary databases such as Google Scholar, but the low quality data found in Google Scholar raises questions about its suitability for research evaluation [52]. Within these databases, the search has focused exclusively on articles and reviews since they are considered certified knowledge (Ramos-Rodrígue & Ruíz-Navarro, 2004 ). The search period was set to the period between 2015, since that is when the 2030 Agenda was established, until December 31, 2020. The selection of articles and reviews was carried out by identifying those that had certain keywords in the title, in the keywords section or in the abstract (Table 2 ). The keywords used to search the databases were defined using the Wordnet database, which was developed by the Cognitive Science Laboratory at Princeton University. It is a lexical database, a reference for the English language, whose design is inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical memory (Miller et al., 1990 ). The keyword “Education” was entered in this database and the different synsets (sets of cognitive synonyms) were obtained, which allowed the search keywords to be defined. The search strategy Table 3   resulted in 508 documents in Scopus and 293 documents in Web of Science. These results were compared and duplicate documents were eliminated, thus giving a final result of 656 documents. After carrying out a content analysis of the title and abstract, the documents that did not cover the ESD were eliminated, reducing the sample to 325 documents. The documents that do not deal with the integration of at least one of the SDGs in education were then eliminated (for example papers that propose innovative courses or that integrate competencies that are related with ESD, such as the student at the centre of learning or critical thinking, but do not directly address at least one SDG), leaving a total of 160 papers. These 160 papers were the sample on which this research was based (Fig. 2  ).  3.3 Findings analysis Once the list of papers had been defined, the analysis tools available at Web of Science and Scopus were used. The following tasks were performed with these tools:• Determination of the number of papers published by year.  • Analysis of the number of articles published by author.  • Analysis of the number of articles published by country.  • Analysis of the number of articles published by institution  • Analysis of the content of the ten most cited articles on the list.  • Analysis of the number of articles published per journal.  • Analysis of the indicators of relevance, impact and prestige of the 10 journals with the most published articles on the list. The indicators analysed were the following: CiteScore, Impact Factor, Normalized Source Factor, and Scimago Journal Rank.    In relation to categorization, a content analysis was carried out in order to detect common points among the documents obtained so that the categories emerged. The system used is inspired by the comparative method (Collier, 1998 ). To establish these categories, the common points shared by the articles were identified. The fundamental objective of the article and the contributions and advances that it offers to the state of the art were the main factors considered. This classification was taken as a starting hypothesis. After that, the adequacy of the categories to classify all the articles was checked paper by paper. When an article was found that did not fit into any category, the classification was rethought with a view to integrating the dissonant element. Several reviews were performed until all the items on the list were properly distributed in the proposed classification.   4 Findings 4.1 Bibliometric analysis 4.1.1 Initial results As can be seen in Fig. 3  , although documents published in 2015 were not detected, probably due to the recent publication of the 2030 Agenda in September 2015, the number of publications has increased considerably in five years, and a boom can be highlighted in the last two years.  4.1.2 Author influence Regarding the authors, there is no author that stands out significantly in terms of the number of publications. This may be a reflection of the small number of experts in the field. There is only one author with three papers and sixteen authors with two papers (see Table 4  ).  4.1.3 Affiliation statistics The distribution by countries reveals a leadership of Spain, followed by the United Kingdom and the United States. These three countries account for approximately half of the sample. On the other hand, from a continental point of view, more research can be highlighted in Europe, followed by America (see Table 5  ).  4.1.4 Analysis by institution In the analysis of the institutions, none are detected that stand out significantly in terms of the number of publications, so there is no institution with a high degree of specialization in this field (Table 6  ).  4.1.5 Citation analysis Table 7   shows the top 10 articles with the highest number of citations. The most cited article has a total of 51 citations, a figure that is not significantly high, which may be related to the recent nature of the research topic or because the papers have been recently published and researchers may not know them.  4.1.6 Sources analysis In the analysis of the sources, the great weight of the three journals with the most publications must be highlighted: Sustainability Switzerland with 49 publications, followed by the International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education with 17, and the International Journal of Management Education with 16 (Table 8  ). These journals, have published approximately half of the publications that are relevant to this area of study. Three impact indicators have been used to assess the relevance of the journals in question: CiteScore, Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP), and SCImago Journal Rank (SJR). CiteScore measures the average number of citations received per document published in the journal. Values are calculated by counting citations over a year for documents published in the three years prior to the calculation and dividing by the number of documents published in those three years. The SNIP measures the impact of citations in a given context and is based on total citations per field of study. The impact of a citation has a greater value in fields where citations are less likely to occur. SJR takes into consideration the prestige of the journal in which the article is published. It uses an algorithm similar to Google to establish rankings between websites. It also takes into account the citations of the article. The indicators reflected in Table 7  express the degree of impact, relevance and importance of the journal, according to these indicators.   4.2 Data clustering using content analysis A content analysis of all the articles on the list of studies was carried out to define categories that classify articles based on common elements, in order to bring some order to the research effort that is being made, and to identify future research suggestions in Education and SGDs. The categories obtained are those shown in Table 9  . Table 10   presents the distribution of the 160 papers on the list in each category, and a compilation of the future research suggestions on Education and SDGs, made by a content analysis of the papers in each category. Moreover, it is also interesting to remark that the most cited articles in the field, shown in Table 7 , cover all the above categories except category 6 Bibliographical reviews , and that half of the articles correspond to category 1 Maturity models to measure the current situation .   5 Framework The systematic review of the literature carried out has made it possible to identify one of the main weaknesses hampering the achievement of the integration of the objectives of sustainable development in teaching, namely, the need for a framework that guides educational institutions in the process of using education for the SDGs achievement. A framework is a useful tool for structuring and organizing information that allows a better study or future implementation of the object in question (Succar, 2009 ; Francisco Zamora-Polo, Luque-Sendra et al., 2019 ). For this reason, the Integration and Re-Engineering (IRIS) group of the Universitat Jaume I of Castellón has developed the SDG4-IRIS framework. The mission of this research group is to research on how to achieve organizations sustainability improving their management and their information systems. The framework was developed taking into account the findings of the systematic literature reviewed performed, because we want to take advantage of methods, tools, etc. proposed in the literature, and the experience of the IRIS group members both as researches in the development and implementation of frameworks and methodologies to support managers to innovate in their organizations (some of them related with sustainability, such as the development and implementation of sustainable supply chains or the use of balanced scorecard for business sustainability management) as well as their experience as managers and educators in universities. The framework is organized in four dimensions (Fig. 4  ): Methodology, Resources, Interest Groups, and Maturity Model. 5.1 Methodology The first dimension, Methodology, is the core dimension that guides the process. This consists of five steps (Fig. 5  ): Project planning  (S1) to plan, organize and manage the schedule and resources needed to complete the project; Strategic planning  to assess the educational institution current situation and to define the objectives, action plans and indicators to measure the degree of fulfilment of the objectives (S2); Implementation  of the actions plans (S3); Measurement  of the indicators (S4); and Evaluation and decision-making  to establish a continuous improvement process (S5). The steps of the methodology are based on the Deming Cycle, also known as the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle, which proposes a process for continuous quality improvement and is widely used in management systems. It is a management philosophy that seeks excellence from a continuous process of small improvements (Chase et al., 2004 ; Lukman & Glavič, 2007 ; Velazquez et al., 2006 ). On the other hand, Activity 1: Participatory process, within Step 2: Strategic Planning, is inspired by the Participatory Conceptual Framework for sustainable transformation through Education proposed by Kioupi and Voulvoulis (2019) , the stages of which are based on the Back Casting methodology, which is considered a best practice in long-term planning in sustainability transitions (Holmberg & Larsson, 2018 ). Other activities and tasks are based in the experience of the authors in the development of frameworks and methodologies to innovate in organizations (see for example Chalmeta & Palomero, 2011 ; Orenga and Chalmeta, 2019 ). Finally, the identified research categories have been taken into account in the design of the methodology. Table 11   details the steps of the methodology, including the activities and tasks, the entity or person responsible for carrying them out and the related dimensions. Finally, regarding the extension of the project, development from Step 1 to Step 5 is planned to last two academic years (Fig. 6  ). Thus, Step 1 and Step 2 will last for one academic year, while Step 3 should begin in the second. Finally, Step 4 and Step 5 will take place at the end of the second year. In addition, in a continuous improvement process, Steps 1 and 2 “Planning year” will start again after Steps 3, 4 and 5 “Implementation, measurement and evaluation”.  5.2 Resources The Resources dimension considers four categories of resources that are necessary for the execution of the methodology: Human resources, Documentary resources, Physical resources and IT resources. 5.2.1 Human resources This, in turn, consists of four types of human resources: Directive, Coordination group, Facilitators and Action groups. Each of them are described in more detail below: Directive. The board of directors of the institution, already established before the start of the project, plays a key role in its success. They must lead and commit to the process, as well as support the coordination and facilitation of resources. Coordination group. This group is constituted at the beginning of the project and its members will be teachers and directors. The objective of this group is to coordinate and manage all the data generated in the different steps of the methodology. In addition, they are responsible for coordinating communication and activities with the different stakeholders and human resources groups. Facilitators. The mission of the facilitators is to deliver the sessions to the students. Therefore, the facilitators will intervene in the Participatory Process of Step 2 and in the curricular and extracurricular activities resulting from the strategy. The facilitators can be teachers at the institution or agents of external stakeholders. External agents are facilitators who will mostly deliver specific sessions (talks or seminars). Action groups. These groups will emerge during the project for specific issues or objectives. They can be constituted simultaneously by different stakeholders. For example: an Energy transition group (Climate Action, SDGs13), whose objective is to study the feasibility of energy transition in the institution, could be made up of students from a scientific-technological bachelor's degree, a facilitator (teacher in the field of technology) and representatives of a Science and Technology Institute.  5.2.2 Documentary resources To carry out the “Participatory process” activity (Step 2) and to design the curricular and extracurricular activities resulting from the strategy, the facilitators need to be trained. To do so, documentary resources are proposed (Table 12  ) that will facilitate the understanding of the SDGs, the knowledge of the key sustainability competencies, the identification of specific learning objectives, and the recognition of learning methods and situations.  5.2.3 Physical resources For the optimal development of the project, a physical space is required where the different stakeholders can develop the programme. This should be a space for dialogue about transformation (Westley et al., 2015 ). These transformation processes, fully compatible with ESD, help mobilize people towards action around a problem, providing opportunities for learning and reflection in contexts of divergent interests (Ely & Marin, 2016 ; Sharpe et al., 2016 ). This space, a Laboratory of transformation through the SDGs, will be a learning environment that boosts innovation, co-creation of solutions, the development of participatory processes, meetings between stakeholders, development of projects or actions, debates, etc.  5.2.4 Information technology resources For the correct management of the project, the development of a web platform is required. The platform will allow the automation of the documentation, project monitoring and communication process, and in addition it will make the project compatible with online/distance learning situations. There must be two minimum sections of the web: project communication and project administration. Project communication. The function of this section is to communicate and publicly report on the status and progress of the project. Furthermore, it will promote information transparency and the awareness of all stakeholders. Project management. The purpose of this administration section is the management and automation of information flows and activities. Access with a user profile will be allowed to the directors, facilitators and coordination group. This section will contain the following sub-sections:-  Document management system. This section will allow the automated recording of the minutes of the tasks carried out in all phases. The minutes must include at least the following data: (1) Name of the programme; (2) Name of the institution; (3) Date; (4) Phase of the methodology; (5) Activity of the methodology; (6) Task of the methodology; (7) Participating interest groups; (8) Facilitator/s of the activity; (9) SDGs treated; (10) Target; (11) Description; and (12) Results.  - Computer support of the project dashboard (See section 5.4.3 ).      5.3 Stakeholders The stakeholders can be divided into two groups: internal or external to the educational institution. In Step 1 of Project Planning, the board of directors and teachers will decide which stakeholders will be the participants in Step 2: Strategic Planning. The more stakeholders are included, the higher the quality of the programme will be. As a reference, the following stakeholders are proposed:- Internal stakeholders : Board of directors, teachers, administrative staff and those with other occupations at the institution, students and families.  - External stakeholders:  civil society, public administrations, companies, organizations and other academic institutions.     5.4 Maturity model Maturity models are widely accepted as a guide for evaluating the business processes of an organization (Ahern et al., 2004 ). Within the scope of this project, the maturity model will be used to make a diagnosis of the initial situation, and in comparison with successive measurements, an evaluation of progress. This data will make it possible to spot key areas for improvement and will therefore confer the strategy with greater quality and effectiveness. The proposed maturity model is made up of three techniques: Questionnaires, Matrix and Project Dashboard. These techniques allow, respectively, (1) evaluation of the knowledge of the interest groups about the SDGs, (2) evaluation of the quality and scope of the strategy, and (3) evaluation of the achievement of the SDGs integration strategy. 5.4.1 Questionnaires The objective of the questionnaires is to evaluate the stakeholders’ knowledge about the SDGs, since the objective of the framework is not only to obtain a strategy but also knowledge about the SDGs. There are questionnaires in the literature that have been designed and could be used as a reference for the implementation of this framework (Maialen Muguerza & Chalmeta, 2020 ; Francisco Zamora-Polo, Sánchez-Martín et al., 2019 ). The questionnaires must be answered by all participating stakeholders, so that the academic institution can measure its contribution to the knowledge and learning of the SDGs in the academic field (internal stakeholders) and in the community environment (external stakeholders).  5.4.2 Matrix The objective of the matrix (Fig. 7  ) is to allow evaluation of the quality and scope of the strategy. Strategy quality is measured based on the results obtained in strategic planning, whereas scope refers to the participating stakeholders. At the crossroads of these variables, the score that assesses the strategy is obtained, with 1 being the minimum score (when managers and teachers carry out Step 2 but no actions are implemented) and 10 is the maximum score (when all stakeholders participate and there is networking with other academic institutions, and the institution has the SDGs fully integrated into its activity, identity, culture and management processes, in a continuous process of improvement). In the case of carrying out Step 2 without implementation, a score equivalent to 5 is obtained, since Step 2 itself is valued as beneficial for understanding the SDGs. Conversely, it is considered that when strategic planning is carried out exclusively by directors and teachers, it cannot exceed 6 points because it contributes to a lesser extent to the participation and empowerment of students and stakeholders.  5.4.3 Project dashboard The project dashboard is the set of indicators that will make it possible to measure the achievement of the project's objectives and the implementation of the action plans. Indicators such as the number of activities carried out, monitoring the timing or participating stakeholders can be used. In the definition of the indicators, the SDGs must be related to their respective goals and the action plans. Once this relationship has been established, quantitative and/or qualitative criteria must be established to measure achievement. For example: it is proposed to promote Goal 13 Climate action. Thus, two actions can be established: 1) reduce the energy consumption of the institution, and 2) carry out an awareness campaign in the community about climate change. Their respective goals could be: 1) to reduce energy consumption by 10%, and 2) the community knows the basics of climate change. The indicators could be, respectively, 1) percentage reduction in energy consumption (the target is a 10% reduction), and 2) improvement of the community's knowledge about climate change, which will be measured with an initial and a final questionnaire.    6 Discussion 6.1 Contributions to theory The work presented in this paper contributes to the literature on Education and Objectives for Sustainable Development, as it extends the existing bibliographical reviews (García, Eizaguirre and Rica, 2020 ; Ambrosio et al., 2019 ; Briceno and Santos, 2019 ): (1) it increases the period of the systematic review between 2015 and 2020; (2) it has a greater coverage of information sources since it jointly uses the Scopus and Web of Science databases; (3) it identifies the main authors, countries and institutions that contribute in the field of Education and the SDGs, using statistical analysis and bibliometric analysis techniques to obtain and compare the most influential works (response to RQ1); (4) through a content analysis, it identifies and proposes six research categories: Maturity models to measure the current situation; Methods to integrate the SDGs at the curricular and extracurricular levels; Strategies and management processes to integrate the SDGs in the Academic Setting; Teaching Methods and Pedagogical Approaches to SDGs; Fundamental Concepts; and Systematic Reviews of the Literature (response to RQ2); and (5) it identifies future research needs in the field of Education and SDGs (response to RQ3). Furthermore, this work proposes a useful framework to guide the transition process towards sustainability through the SDGs in educational institutions (response to RQ4). The framework, which is based on current advances in the research field, makes it possible to: (1) help to eliminate the compartmentalized or annexed view of ESD in the curriculum design, so that ESD becomes the essence of teaching and learning, which is one of the great shortcomings detected by researchers (Rieckmann, 2017 ); (2) help solve the problem of poor teacher training, since the framework is designed to ensure they learn by doing; (3) integrate the vision of the different stakeholders from the education sector; (4) guide educational institutions in the process of incorporating the SDGs, ensuring that the process is easily adaptable to the context and level of commitment of the institution; (5) help educational institutions to integrate the SDGs in their activity; and (6) promote continuous improvement by understanding sustainability as a process, not as a goal in itself. The framework promotes continuous improvement, thanks to a maturity model that combines the measurement of stakeholders’ knowledge and the diagnosis of programmes, plans and institutions, resulting in a diagnosis of the situation and results that are broader than other existing frameworks. Therefore, this work covers an important research gap: the scarcity of systematic and extensive reviews of the recent research on Education and Objectives for Sustainable Development, which could limit its impact. As a result of the study, some conclusions can be drawn regarding the literature on Education for SDGs achievement. First, it was seen how the number of publications is still limited although the trend is clearly rising, both in the number of publications per year and in the number of citations per year. From this, it can be deduced that there is a growing interest in this area, although due to papers have been recently published, researchers may not know them and for this reason the number of citations is still low. Second, sub-sections authors’ influence and analysis by institution do not reveal any trend and pattern. Third, in terms of productivity, Sánchez-Martín, J. is identified as the author with the most publications in the field of study, and Spain, United Kingdom and USA are the countries that have contributed with the greatest number of publications. This shows that the two regions that are more productive are Anglo-Saxon and Europe. This may be due to a major encourage with sustainability in this regions. Fourth, regarding the source analysis, the main sources are educational journals that include Education for sustainable development or for advancing in UN SDGs, and journals that are partially or fully addressed on sustainability. Sustainability Switzerland is the source with the most papers published. Fifth, a comparative analysis of the content made it possible to put forward a classification by categories that include all the papers on the list. This classification in six research categories facilitates the future work of researchers interested in this field because it identifies common shared patterns and elements in every category, and shows those aspects that were addressed to a lesser extent and need future research. Finally, another important contribution of this work is that due to there are no frameworks to support educational institutions in how to use Education for the achievement of the SDGs, a new framework to cover this research gap has been developed based in the results of this systematic literature review. It was already proved in the literature that conceptual frameworks can be derived from systematic literature reviews (Zimon et al., 2019 ).  6.2 Contributions to managerial practice This works offers different opportunities to practitioners. This study can offer managers of educational institutions and consulting firms different schools of thought that will enable them to use Education for the SDGs achievement. Furthermore, through the classification of the literature in six categories, practitioners can: (1) assess the current state of the art in integrating Education for the SDGs achievement in educational institutions, in terms of conceptualization, methods, tools, impact, specific solutions, and case studies; (2) identify the future requirements in the six categories to make appropriate decisions on whether to invest and improve current tools/methods; (3) analyse the implications of using education for the SDGs achievement. Finally, the framework offers practitioners a guide with the different activities, tasks, methods, and tools to carry out in the process of using education for the SDGs achievement.   7 Conclusion Since the Rio Summit in 1992, education has been considered fundamental for the achievement of sustainable development. Today, almost 30 years later, ESD is still considered a complement to traditional education, and specific actions and a lack of global sense tend to prevail in academic institutions. To advance in this line of knowledge, in this paper, a bibliographical analysis of the literature on Education and SDGs published since 2015 has been carried out. A sample of 114 papers were analysed in order to identify the evolution over time of the number of articles included on the list, the evolution of the number of citations generated by these articles, the number of articles published by author, the number of articles published by country, the number of articles published by institution, the content of the 10 most cited articles on the list, the number of articles published per journal, the indicators of relevance, impact and prestige of the 10 journals with the most articles published on the list, and the established and emerging research categories on the topic. The bibliographical analysis has confirmed the initial hypothesis that an analysis of current research could facilitate the advancement of future research in this field. The main conclusion is that the area of study requires more research and a higher number of annual publications. Although the number of publications has increased considerably in the last two years, the citation of the main papers is still low. It is also necessary to improve the relevance of the research carried out, something that could be achieved by accessing journals of greater impact. It has also showed that the regions that are more productive are Anglo-Saxon and Europe. Finally, the research conducted in three of the six categories identified should also be improved, since the majority of papers have been published in the other three categories: maturity models, integration of the SDGs, and educational and pedagogic methods. On the other hand, based on the analysis of the existing bibliography, the need to develop a framework to guide academic institutions towards the achievement of the SDGs and the promotion of sustainable development has been detected. The framework makes it possible to cover the existing need for frameworks that guide the global process of change towards sustainability in educational institutions. It is a tool available for educational institutions that wish to contribute to the scope of the SDGs and make the institution and the community more sustainable places in which to live. Finally, it is important to highlight the limitations of the study. This research was limited mainly by (1) the biases introduced by studying only two bibliographical databases: the Web of Science and Scopus. There was also a language bias, due to the fact that these databases include mostly articles that were written in English, and the search was conducted only in English. Other databases could be used to improve and compare the results; (2) choosing a series of specific keywords introduced another bias by default. Other keywords could have been used and might have yielded different results; (3) the bibliometric analysis for reviewing the literature based on Misha (2019) was used. Other methods, such as network analysis, might be used for such an analysis; and finally, (4) the literature was classified in six research clusters. Other methods may result in other classifications. In relation to the limitations of the framework, this research could benefit from the application of the framework to educational institutions, thereby generating case studies that could be used as a reference for practitioners. Further future research could address the adaptability of the framework in non-academic institutions in order to raise awareness among stakeholders about the SDGs and generate business strategies in a participatory manner. Another limitations that could have improved the results are that chapters and books have not been included in the sample, and that sustainability as a term has not been considered in the keywords. Finally, future research could be focused in analysing more the qualitative findings of every category.
