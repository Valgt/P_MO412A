International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals Beijing 100094 China     The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by the 193 member states of the United Nations (UN) in 2015, include a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for everyone globally. Since it is “action-oriented, global in nature, and universally applicable”, quantifying the progress of achieving SDGs is essential to track global efforts toward sustainable development and guide policy development and implementation [1] . A compelling SDG process demands the “collection, processing, analysis, and dissemination of an unprecedented amount of reliable, timely, accessible, and sufficiently disaggregated data”. However, data availability remains a vital challenge. Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) show that most countries lack official data to measure the progress of their SDG indicators [2] . The usage of multi-source data, especially non-official data, is challenging for SDG researchers and data providers. Firstly, data are always distributed ubiquitously across places, sectors, and stakeholders, and different data sources are usually isolated from each other, which hinders its utilization in estimating and achieving SDGs from an integrated perspective. On a technical spectrum, data coming from non-official sources mostly do not comply with traditional quality standards. It is difficult to establish trends, ensure continuity, and, in several cases, understand data generation. In the past decade, the world’s rapidly developing technological information processing capacities and the voluminous heterogeneous datasets have provided unique opportunities in SDG-related research. There are vast geographically distributed datasets captured from multiple sources to assess SDGs. It includes geospatial data, i.e., satellite data, citizen-generated data, privately held data, and administrative data. To fully apply these datasets in compiling SDG indicators at scale with multi-modal datasets, massive data migration would be costly. It is impossible to physically integrate large-scale datasets for real applications in several cases. Furthermore, several SDGs involve the measurements of the social economic phenomenon, which include quantitatively characterizing human activities and society. Datasets acquired by social media, mobile phones, financial agencies, and governments could boost the assessment of SDG progress to provide a full profile of the social-economical activities of individuals and organizations. However, several datasets are commercially or privately owned and not publicly available. The stakeholders of the datasets, not only the data owners, and the persons and organizations associated with the data contents, are concerned about intellectual problems and data privacy. For instance, SDG3 regarding “Good Health and Well-being” would help utilize personal medical records and diagnosis datasets owned by hospitals, which will introduce issues in data sharing at a large scale [3] . Along with these challenges, not all data are suitable for direct access or sharing due to privacy, ownership, trust, and incentive concerns. All of the aforementioned factors create bottlenecks for fully realizing the data’s potential. We called such data “closed data”. This significant number of “closed data” are like a buried “gold mine”. We identified a new trend of decentralized data government paradigm to address these challenges. It enables a model-sharing framework for using closed data without sharing them. Its application will help add value from the conventionally unusable data and trigger a transformation of data governance for better data collaboration in SDGs globally. (i) A New Data-driven Paradigm in SDGs . In SDGs, storage, management, and analysis of multi-modal datasets are inevitable issues. Furthermore, data in SDGs are always distributed across regions, sectors, and stakeholders. Thus, an effective solution is required for sharing the products produced from the data contents rather than the massive datasets. Recent technological developments, such as federated learning [4] , blockchains [5] , and multi-party computation, enable computation and modeling with distributed (and isolated) data. Federated learning enables the development of AI models based on distributed datasets from multiple parties without the need for data collection, thereby preventing data leakage and privacy violations. It is based on an iterative process that includes both local model training and global model aggregation. In each round, data owners are given a global shared model and are asked to generate a set of potential model updates based on the local data. After that, the local updates are processed and aggregated into a single global update, which is then applied to the global model. Current federated learning algorithms are communication efficient and privacy-preserving, and they have shown promise in a variety of scenarios. Aside from federated learning, certain other frameworks, such as Blockchain with decentralized management and incentive mechanism, and secure multi-party computation for enhanced privacy protection, are also compatible with distributed computation and modeling [5] . These frameworks and approaches have provided a consolidated foundation for the future development of SDG research. Fig. 1   illustrates the workflow based on the new paradigm. (1) Data can be classified as open or closed depending on its level of accessibility: open data are available to all users, but closed data are the opposite. (2) For open data, data can be collected, processed, and managed centrally. A standardized data quality assurance framework can be applied to the collected data and statistics, thus avoiding cross-country inconsistency. (3) As for closed data, model information extracted from the raw data is considered a proxy. The iteration of local model training and global model aggregation integrates with local knowledge and generates a stronger model. Blockchain and encryption tech can be introduced here for incentive and enhanced privacy. (4) Data-based sharing paradigm allows the distribution and reuse of data and methods and leads to the efficient creation of SDG products. Model-based sharing paradigm offers global decentralized learning models and provides consistent information processing and SDG assessing methods for different areas. (ii) Best practices with new paradigm in SDGs . (1) SDG13. The Net-Zero goal is an international ambition in the framework of the SDGs, as it aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to combat climate change [6] . Quantitative GHG emission disclosure by governments, NGOs (non-governmental organizations), and businesses would be vital to meet the goal. To ensure the transparency of the Net-Zero endeavor, detailed information is needed for GHG accounting and disclosure [7] . However, the emission-related datasets are sensitive information for stakeholders, and the disclosure of the datasets would introduce privacy issues. The decentralized data-driven paradigm would be an actionable solution for accurate and trusted emission accounting and disclosure. The technologies on the decentralized framework, such as blockchain and smart contract, could be adopted for tackling climate change, through the carbon and climate disclosure [8] . With the decentralized framework, GHG accounting and disclosure, Net-Zero strategic planning could be conducted in a distributed environment by sharing model parameters rather than detailed datasets. Stakeholders disclose and share GHG emission information using well-trained models, while the models are trained with raw datasets within the local scope of associated data owners. Stakeholders could share GHG emission information without explicitly disclosing raw datasets to the public. (2) SDG2. SDG2 seeks sustainable solutions to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture [9] . Numerous previous studies have focused on the indicators of SDG2 targets [10] . Leaf area index (LAI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and potential biomass were retrieved using global remote sensing data with medium or low resolution. High-resolution data availability becomes a bottleneck for more accurate results. Federated learning-based agricultural monitoring systems that use emerging deep learning technologies contribute to the resolution of this problem. The system enables multiple remote sensing data owners to train an algorithm using local data and employs a shared prediction model to monitor agricultural productivity or disease occurrence. Instead of sharing ground survey data, samples, and high-resolution images, federated learning trains a classification algorithm across multiple decentralized servers holding local ground survey data, samples, and high-resolution images. For example, soybean yield prediction was conducted based on shared remote sensing models between participants while keeping data independence in the corn belt of US states [11] . Distributed learning provides a new method of data collaboration, revoking a paradigm shift in SDG data governance. It preserves the data locality and transforms “closed data” to “protected data” by merging multi-source models. During the paradigm shift, more actions like technical development, policy implementation, infrastructure construction, etc., are urgently required. (3) Using innovative deep learning models to bridge SDG data gaps. Advanced sensing devices generate abundant and frequently-updated data, which bridges SDG data gaps with deep learning models. Federated learning allows devices to collaborate on building models without having access to each other’s private dataset. However, the exchange of model updates also incurs extra computational and communication burden, and privacy concerns regarding personal data and server trustworthiness. (4) Balanced policy design with open science as the general guiding principle. We believe that policies contribute to a friendly environment by developing the future SDGs worldwide to boost model sharing and help unleash the full potential of “closed data” for SDGs. We still need to pursue open data sharing, especially in areas where data are in gray status between open and closed. Federated learning can be a supplement to the current open science models, and its usability depends on the cost comparison between policy interoperability and federated model performance. Among all policies, transparency, reproducibility, responsibility, accountability, and others are the highlighted rules in pursuing open science. Federated learning system design should follow such rules to facilitate further sharing of knowledge. The FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) [12]  principle, the CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) [13]  principle, and others clarify the balance between stakeholders for resources sharing in SDGs research. (5) Development of robust research infrastructures as consolidated foundations. Robust and reliable infrastructures are important to support different scales of alignment between potential partners, like the practices in the Global Open Science Cloud Initiative. Platforms based on federated learning have emerged recently, but several technical issues remain unresolved, including communication efficiency, incentive mechanisms, model security, and server trustworthiness. (6) SDGs leave no one behind. Efforts from all stakeholders (including governments, private sectors, NGOs, scientists, citizens, etc.) are needed to build a harmonious model-sharing data ecosystem and an easy-to-use model-sharing platform must be established to encourage participation. China has set up an International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals (CBAS), featuring multidisciplinary research about Earth system science, social and economic sciences, and sustainability science [14,15] . CBAS provides a range of essential services, including data sharing, technology solutions, decision-making support, a think tank, and capacity building for developing countries to address the most challenging problems to implement SDGs, like technical barriers and data shortages. A new paradigm of SDGs research is expected to improve data collaboration and data value creation, generating new opportunities for innovations in technologies. The proposed distributed learning paradigm in this paper focuses on the “closed-data” challenges that threaten our global ability to deliver the SDGs. It is hoped that as the new paradigm is proposed, more good examples from data owners will emerge, and that multistakeholder efforts will aid in identifying and implementing solutions to advance the SDGs.
